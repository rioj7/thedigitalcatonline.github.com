The well-known Uncle Bob talks a lot about this concept at conferences and wrote some very interesting posts about it. What he calls "Clean Architecture" is a way of structuring a software system, a set of consideration (more than strict rules) about the different layers and the role of the actors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he clearly states in a post aptly titled &lt;a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;The Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, the idea behind this design is not new, being built on a set of concepts that have been pushed by many software engineers over the last 3 decades. One of the first implementations may be found in the Boundary-Control-Entity model proposed by Ivar Jacobson in his masterpiece "Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach" published in 1992, but Martin lists other more recent versions of this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not repeat here what he had already explained better than I can do, so I will just point out some resources you may check to start exploring these concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;The Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; a post by Robert Martin that concisely describes the goals of the architecture. It also lists resources that describe similar architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/12/TheOpenClosedPrinciple.html"&gt;The Open Closed Principle&lt;/a&gt; a post by Robert Martin not strictly correlated with the Clean Architecture concept but important for the separation concept.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;(upcoming) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Architecture-Robert-C-Martin-x/dp/0134494164/ref=la_B000APG87E_1_3?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1479146201&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Martin, published by Prentice Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to show how to build a web service in Python from scratch using a clean architecture. One of the main advantages of this layered design is testability, so I will develop it following a TDD approach. The project was initially developed from scratch in around 3 hours of work. Given the toy nature of the project some choices have been made to simplify the resulting code. Whenever meaningful I will point out those simplifications and discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about TDD in Python read the posts in &lt;a href="/categories/tdd/"&gt;this category&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Project overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the "Rent-o-matic" project (fans of Day of the Tentacle may get the reference) is to create a simple search engine on top of a dataset of objects which are described by some quantities. The search engine shall allow to set some filters to narrow the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the dataset are storage rooms for rent described by the following quantities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An unique identifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A size in square meters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A renting price in euros/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latitude and longitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pushed by the clean architecture model, we are interested in separating the different layers of the system. The architecture is described by four layers, which however can be implemented by more than four actual code modules. I will give here a brief description of those layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the level in which the domain models are described. Since we work in Python, I will put here the class that represent my storage rooms, with the data contained in the database, and whichever data I think is useful to perform the core business processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand that the models in this layer are different from the usual models of framework like Django. These models are not connected with a storage system, so they cannot be directly saved or queried using methods of their classes. They may however contain helper methods that implement code related to the business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layer contains the use cases implemented by the system. In this simple example there will be only one use case, which is the list of storage rooms according to the given filters. Here you would put for example a use case that shows the detail of a given storage room or every business process you want to implement, such as booking a storage room, filling it with goods, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interface Adapters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layer corresponds to the boundary between the business logic and external systems and implements the APIs used to exchange data with them. Both the storage system and the user interface are external systems that need to exchange data with the use cases and this layer shall provide an interface for this data flow. In this project the presentation part of this layer is provided by a JSON serializer, on top of which an external web service may be built. The storage adapter shall define here the common API of the storage systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;External interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the architecture is made by external systems that implement the interfaces defined in the previous layer. Here for example you will find a web server that implements (REST) entry points, which access the data provided by use cases through the JSON serializer. You will also find here the storage system implementation, for example a given database such as MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API and shades of grey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word API is of uttermost importance in a clean architecture. Every layer may be accessed by an API, that is a fixed collection of entry points (methods or objects). Here "fixed" means "the same among every implementation", obviously an API may change with time. Every presentation tool, for example, will access the same use cases, and the same methods, to obtain a set of domain models, which are the output of that particular use case. It is up to the presentation layer to format data according to the specific presentation media, for example HTML, PDF, images, etc. If you understand plugin-based architectures you already grasped the main concept of a separate, API-driven component (or layer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same concept is valid for the storage layer. Every storage implementation shall provide the same methods. When dealing with use cases you shall not be concerned with the actual system that stores data, it may be a MongoDB local installation, a cloud storage system or a trivial in-memory dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation between layers, and the content of each layer, is not always fixed and immutable. A well-designed system shall also cope with practical world issues such as performances, for example, or other specific needs. When designing an architecture it is very important to know "what is where and why", and this is even more important when you "bend" the rules. Many issues do not have a black-or-white answer, and many decisions are "shades of grey", that is it is up to you to justify why you put something in a given place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind however, that you should not break the &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; of the clean architecture, in particular you shall be inflexible about the data flow (see the "Crossing boundaries" section in the original post of Robert Martin). If you break the data flow, you are basically invalidating the whole structure. Let me stress it again: &lt;strong&gt;never break the data flow&lt;/strong&gt;. A simple example of breaking the data flow is to let a use case output a Python class instead of a &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; of that class such as a JSON string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Project structure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take a look at the final structure of the project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;structure here&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global structure of the package has been built with Cookiecutter, and I will run quickly through that part. The &lt;code&gt;rentomatic&lt;/code&gt; directory contains the following subdirectories: &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;repositories&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;serializers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;use_cases&lt;/code&gt;. Those directories reflect the layered structure introduced in the previous section, and the structure of the &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; directory mirrors this structure so that tests are easily found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code in &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic"&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to fork it and experiment, change it, and find better solutions to the problem I will discuss in this post. The source code contains tagged commits to allow you to follow the actual development as presented in the post. You can find the current tag in the &lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tag name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; label under the section titles. The label is actually a link to the tagged commit on GitHub, if you want to see the code without cloning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Project initialization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step01"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step01&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Cookiecutter package creates an environment like the one I am creating in this section. I will keep the following explanation so that you can see how to manage requirements and configurations, but for your next project consider using this automated tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually like maintaining a Python virtual environment inside the project, so I will create a temporary virtualenv to install cookiecutter, create the project, and remove the virtualenv. Cookiecutter is going to ask you some questions about you and the project, to provide an initial file structure. We are going to build our own testing environment, so it is safe to answer no to &lt;code&gt;use_pytest&lt;/code&gt;. Since this is a demo project we are not going to need any publishing feature, so you can answer no to &lt;code&gt;use_pypi_deployment_with_travis&lt;/code&gt; as well. The project does not have a command line interface, and you can safely create the author file and use any license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;virtualenv venv3 -p python3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv3/bin/activate
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now answer the questions, then finish creating the project with the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;deactivate
rm -fR venv3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; rentomatic
virtualenv venv3 -p python3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv3/bin/activate
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Get rid of the &lt;code&gt;requirements_dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; file that Cookiecutter created for you. I usually store virtualenv requirements in different hierarchical files to separate production, development and testing environments, so create the &lt;code&gt;requirements&lt;/code&gt; directory and the relative files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mkdir requirements
touch requirements/prod.txt
touch requirements/dev.txt
touch requirements/test.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain specific packages used to test the project. Since to test the project you also need to install the packages for the production environment the file will first include the production one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r prod.txt

pytest
tox
coverage
pytest-cov
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain packages used during the development process and shall install also test and production package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r test.txt

pip
wheel
flake8
Sphinx
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(taking advantage of the fact that &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; already includes &lt;code&gt;prod.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the main &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file of the project will just import &lt;code&gt;requirements/prod.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r prod.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Obviously you are free to find the project structure that better suits your need or preferences. This is the structure we are going to use in this project but nothing forces you to follow it in your personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation allows you to install a full-fledged development environment on your machine, while installing only testing tools in a testing environment like the Travis platform and to further reduce the amount of dependencies in the production case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I am not using version tags in the requirements files. This is because this project is not going to be run in a production environment, so we do not need to freeze the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember at this point to install the development requirements in your virtualenv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; testing library needs to be configured. This is the &lt;code&gt;pytest.ini&lt;/code&gt; file that you can create in the root directory (where the &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; file is located)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[pytest]
minversion = 2.0
norecursedirs = .git .tox venv* requirements*
python_files = test*.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To run the tests during the development of the project just execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ py.test -sv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to check the coverage, i.e. the amount of code which is run by your tests or "covered", execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ py.test --cov-report term-missing --cov&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;rentomatic
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about test coverage check the official documentation of the &lt;a href="http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Coverage.py&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;pytest-cov&lt;/a&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly suggest the use of the &lt;code&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt; package to check that your Python code is PEP8 compliant. This is the &lt;code&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt; configuration that you can put in your &lt;code&gt;setup.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[flake8]
ignore = D203
exclude = .git, venv*, docs
max-complexity = 10
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To check the compliance of your code with the PEP8 standard execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ flake8
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Flake8 documentation is available &lt;a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that every step in this post produces tested code and a of coverage of 100%. One of the benefits of a clean architecture is the separation between layers, and this guarantees a great degree of testability. Note however that in this tutorial, in particular in the REST sections, some tests have been omitted in favour of a simpler description of the architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Domain models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step02"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step02&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start with a simple definition of the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; model. As said before, the clean architecture models are very lightweight, or at least they are lighter than their counterparts in a framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the TDD methodology the first thing that I write are the tests. Create the &lt;code&gt;tests/domain/test_storageroom.py&lt;/code&gt; and put this code inside it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_model_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.09998975&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_model_from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.09998975&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With these two tests we ensure that our model can be initialized with the correct values and that can be created from a dictionary. In this first version all the parameters of the model are required. Later we could want to make some of them optional, and in that case we will have to add the relevant tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's write the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; class in the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/domain/storageroom.py&lt;/code&gt; file. Do not forget to create the &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file in the subdirectories of the project, otherwise Python will not be able to import the modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared.domain_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The model is very simple, and requires no further explanation. One of the benefits of a clean architecture is that each layer contains small pieces of code that, being isolated, shall perform simple tasks. In this case the model provides an initialization API and stores the information inside the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;from_dict&lt;/code&gt; method comes in handy when we have to create a model from data coming from another layer (such as the database layer or the query string of the REST layer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could be tempted to try to simplify the &lt;code&gt;from_dict&lt;/code&gt; function, abstracting it and providing it through a &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; class. Given that a certain level of abstraction and generalization is possible and desirable, the initialization part of the models shall probably deal with various different cases, and thus is better off being implemented directly in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;DomainModel&lt;/code&gt; abstract base class is an easy way to categorize the model for future uses like checking if a class is a model in the system. For more information about this use of Abstract Base Classes in Python see &lt;a href="/blog/2016/04/03/abstract-base-classes-in-python/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Serializers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step03"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step03&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model needs to be serialized if we want to return it as a result of an API call. The typical serialization format is JSON, as this is a broadly accepted standard for web-based API. The serializer is not part of the model, but is an external specialized class that receives the model instance and produces a representation of its structure and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the JSON serialization of our &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; class put in the &lt;code&gt;tests/serializers/test_storageroom_serializer.py&lt;/code&gt; file the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_serializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;srs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_serialize_domain_storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;        {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;size&amp;quot;: 200,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;price&amp;quot;: 10,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;longitude&amp;quot;: -0.09998975,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot;: 51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;srs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Put in the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/serializers/storageroom_serializer.py&lt;/code&gt; file the code that makes the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;JSONEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;to_serialize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;longitude&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to_serialize&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Providing a class that inherits from &lt;code&gt;json.JSONEncoder&lt;/code&gt; let us use the &lt;code&gt;json.dumps(room, cls=StorageRoomEncoder)&lt;/code&gt; syntax to serialize the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain degree of repetition in the code we wrote, and this is the annoying part of a clean architecture. Since we want to isolate layers as much as possible and create lightweight classes we end up somehow repeating certain types of actions. For example the serialization code that assigns attributes of a &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; to JSON attributes is very similar to that we use to create the object from a dictionary. Not exactly the same, obviously, but the two functions are very close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Use cases (part 1)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step04"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step04&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to implement the actual business logic our application wants to expose to the outside world. Use cases are the place where we implement classes that query the repository, apply business rules, logic, and whatever transformation we need for our data, and return the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those requirements in mind, let us start to build a use case step by step. The simplest use case we can create is one that fetches all the storage rooms from the repository and returns them. Please note that we did not implement any repository layer yet, so our tests will mock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the skeleton for a basic test of a use case that lists all the storage rooms. Put this code in the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;913694c6-435a-4366-ba0d-da5334a611b2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.45994069&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.33894476&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.39916678&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The test is straightforward. First we mock the repository so that is provides a &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method that returns the list of models we created above the test. Then we initialize the use case with the repo and execute it, collecting the result. The first thing we check is if the repository method was called without any parameter, and the second is the effective correctness of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the implementation of the use case that makes the test pass. Put the code in the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/storageroom_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With such an implementation of the use case, however, we will soon experience issues. For starters, we do not have a standard way to transport the call parameters, which means that we do not have a standard way to check for their correctness either. The second problem is that we miss a standard way to return the call results and consequently we lack a way to communicate if the call was successful of if it failed, and in the latter case what are the reasons of the failure. This applies also to the case of bad parameters discussed in the previous point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want thus to introduce some structures to wrap input and outputs of our use cases. Those structures are called request and response objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Requests and responses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step05"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step05&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Request and response objects are an important part of a clean architecture, as they transport call parameters, inputs and results from outside the application into the use cases layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, requests are objects created from incoming API calls, thus they shall deal with things like incorrect values, missing parameters, wrong formats, etc. Responses, on the other hand, have to contain the actual results of the API calls, but shall also be able to represent error cases and to deliver rich information on what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual implementation of request and response objects is completely free, the clean architecture says nothing about them. The decision on how to pack and represent data is up to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment we just need a &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; that can be initialized without parameters, so let us create the file &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; and put there a test for this object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_storageroom_list_request_object_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_file_list_request_object_from_empty_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While at the moment this request object is basically empty, it will come in handy as soon as we start having parameters for the list use case. The code of the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; is the following and goes into the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The response object is also very simple, since for the moment we just need a successful response. Unlike the request, the response is not linked to any particular use case, so the test file can be named &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_success_is_true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the actual response object is in the file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/response_object.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Use cases (part 2)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step06"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step06&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have implemented the request and response object we can change the test code to include those structures. Change the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; to contain this code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;215&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The new version of the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_case/storageroom_use_cases.py&lt;/code&gt; file is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let us consider what we have achieved with our clean architecture up to this point. We have a very lightweight model that can be serialized to JSON and which is completely independent from other parts of the system. The code also contains a use case that, given a repository that exposes a given API, extracts all the models and returns them contained in a structured object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are missing some objects, however. For example, we have not implemented any unsuccessful response object or validated the incoming request object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore these missing parts of the architecture let us improve the current use case to accept a &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter that represents some filters that we want to apply to the extracted list of models. This will generate some possible error conditions for the input, forcing us to introduce some validation for the incoming request object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Requests and validation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step07"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step07&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to add a &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the request. Through that parameter the caller can add different filters by specifying a name and a value for each filter (for instance &lt;code&gt;{'price_lt': 100}&lt;/code&gt; to get all results with a price lesser than 100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to change the request object, starting from the test. The new version of the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; file is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_storageroom_list_request_object_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_storageroom_list_request_object_from_dict_with_invalid_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;has_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see I added the &lt;code&gt;assert req.filters is None&lt;/code&gt; check to the original two tests, then I added 5 tests to check if filters can be specified and to test the behaviour of the object with an invalid filter parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the tests pass we have to change our &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; class. There are obviously multiple possible solutions that you can come up with, and I recommend you to try to find your own. This is the one I usually employ. The file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/request_object.py&lt;/code&gt; becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;has_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Is not iterable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;has_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me review this new code bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, two helper objects have been introduced, &lt;code&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt;. They are different because an invalid request shall contain the validation errors, but both can be converted to booleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; accepts an optional &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter when instantiated. There are no validation checks in the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method because this is considered to be an internal method that gets called when the parameters have already been validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the &lt;code&gt;from_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method performs the validation of the &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter, if it is present. I leverage the &lt;code&gt;collections.Mapping&lt;/code&gt; abstract base class to check if the incoming parameter is a dictionary-like object and return either an &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we can now tell bad requests from good ones we need to introduce a new type of response as well, to manage bad requests or other errors in the use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Responses and failures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step08"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step08&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if the use case encounter an error? Use cases can encounter a wide set of errors: validation errors, as we just discussed in the previous section, but also business logic errors or errors that come from the repository layer. Whatever the error, the use case shall always return an object with a known structure (the response), so we need a new object that provides a good support for different types of failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As happened for the requests there is no unique way to provide such an object, and the following code is just one of the possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to expand the &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; file, adding tests for failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ResponseError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;This is a response error&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is some boilerplate code, basically pytest fixtures that we will use in the following tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_success_is_true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_is_false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two basic tests to check that both the old &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; and the new &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; objects behave consistently when converted to boolean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_success_contains_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; object contains the call result in the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_has_type_and_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_contains_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These two tests ensure that the &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; object provides the same interface provided by the successful one and that the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; parameter are accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_initialization_with_exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Just an error message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Exception: Just an error message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_from_invalid_request_object_with_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Is mandatory&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t be blank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;path: Is mandatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path: can&amp;#39;t be blank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We sometimes want to create responses from Python exceptions that can happen in the use case, so we test that &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; objects can be initialized with a generic exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last we have the tests for the &lt;code&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object()&lt;/code&gt; method that automate the initialization of the response from an invalid request. If the request contains errors (remember that the request validates itself), we need to put them into the response message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last test uses a class attribute to classify the error. The &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; class will contain three predefined errors that can happen when running the use case, namely &lt;code&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;. This categorization is an attempt to capture the different types of issues that can happen when dealing with an external system through an API. &lt;code&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; contains all those errors that are related to the resources contained in the repository, for instance when you cannot find an entry given its unique id. &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; describes all those errors that occur when the request parameters are wrong or missing. &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; encompass the errors that happen in the underlying system at operating system level, such as a failure in a filesystem operation, or a network connection error while fetching data from the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case has the responsibility to manage the different error conditions arising from the Python code and to convert them into an error description made of one of the three types I just described and a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's write the &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; class that makes the tests pass. This can be the initial definition of the class. Put it in &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/response_object.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ResourceError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ParametersError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SystemError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;type_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;type_&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_format_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_format_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Through the &lt;code&gt;_format_message()&lt;/code&gt; method we enable the class to accept both string messages and Python exceptions, which is very handy when dealing with external libraries that can raise exceptions we do not know or do not want to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This property makes the class comply with the &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; API, providing the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which is an aptly formatted dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
                             &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As explained before, the &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; type encompasses all those errors that come from an invalid set of parameters, which is the case of this function, that shall be called whenever the request is wrong, which means that some parameters contain errors or are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since building failure responses is a common activity it is useful to have helper methods, so I add three tests for the building functions to the &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_build_resource_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_resource_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We add the relevant methods to the class and change the &lt;code&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object()&lt;/code&gt; method to leverage the &lt;code&gt;build_parameters_error()&lt;/code&gt; new method. Change the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; file to contain this code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_resource_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
                             &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Use cases (part 3)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step09"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step09&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our implementation of responses and requests is finally complete, so now we can implement the last version of our use case. The use case correctly returns a &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; object but is still missing a proper validation of the incoming request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's change the test in the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; file and add two more tests. The resulting set of tests (after the &lt;code&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/code&gt; fixture) is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain.storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the test we already wrote, but the &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method is called with &lt;code&gt;filters=None&lt;/code&gt; to reflect the added parameter. The import line has slightly changed as well, given that we are now importing both &lt;code&gt;response_objects&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;request_objects&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/code&gt; fixture has not changed and has been omitted from the code snippet to keep it short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_with_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;qry_filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;qry_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;qry_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test checks that the value of the &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; key in the dictionary used to create the request is actually used when calling the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_handles_generic_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Just an error message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_handles_bad_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;filters: Is not iterable&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This last two tests check the behaviour of the use case when the repository raises an exception or when the request is badly formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/storageroom_use_cases.py&lt;/code&gt; to contain the new use case implementation that makes all the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the first thing that the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method does is to check if the request is valid, otherwise returns a &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; build with the same request object. Then the actual business logic is implemented, calling the repository and returning a success response. If something goes wrong in this phase the exception is caught and returned as an aptly formatted &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Intermezzo: refactoring&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step10"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clean architecture is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a framework, so it provides very few generic features, unlike products like for example Django, which provide models, ORM, and all sorts of structures and libraries. Nevertheless, some classes can be isolated from our code and provided as a library, so that we can reuse the code. In this section I will guide you through a refactoring of the code we already have, during which we will isolate common features for requests, responses, and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already isolated the response object. We can move the &lt;code&gt;test_valid_request_object_cannot_be_used&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; since it tests a generic behaviour and not something related to the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; model and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can move the &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; classes from &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/request_object.py&lt;/code&gt;, making the necessary changes to the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; class that now inherits from an external class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case is the class that undergoes the major changes. The &lt;code&gt;UseCase&lt;/code&gt; class is tested by the following code in the &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_use_case_cannot_process_valid_requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MagicMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; \
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;NotImplementedError: process_request() not implemented by UseCase class&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test checks that the &lt;code&gt;UseCase&lt;/code&gt; class cannot be actually used to process incoming requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_use_case_can_process_invalid_requests_and_returns_response_failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;someparam&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;someparam: somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test runs the use case with an invalid request and check if the response is correct. Since the request is wrong the response type is &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, as this represents an issue in the request parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_use_case_can_manage_generic_exception_from_process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TestException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TestException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;TestException: somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test makes the use case raise an exception. This type of error is categorized as &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, which is a generic name for an exception which is not related to request parameters or actual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this last test the idea is that of exposing the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;code&gt;UseCase&lt;/code&gt; class and to call the &lt;code&gt;process_request()&lt;/code&gt; method defined by each child class, which is the actual use case we are implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; file contains the following code that makes the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;process_request() not implemented by UseCase class&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/storageroom_use_cases.py&lt;/code&gt; now contains the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;The repository layer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step11"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository layer is the one in which we run the data storage system. As you saw when we implemented the use case we access the data storage through an API, in this case the &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method of the repository. The level of abstraction provided by a repository level is higher than that provided by an ORM or by a tool like SQLAlchemy. The repository layer provides only the endpoints that the application needs, with an interface which is tailored on the specific business problems the application implements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify the matter in terms of concrete technologies, SQLAlchemy is a wonderful tool to abstract the access to an SQL database, so the internal implementation of the repository layer could use it to access a PostgreSQL database. But the external API of the layer is not that provided by SQLAlchemy. The API is a (usually reduced) set of functions that the use cases call to get the data, and indeed the internal implementation could also use raw SQL queries on a proprietary network interface. The repository does not even need to be based on a database. We can have a repository layer that fetches data from a REST service, for example, or that makes remote procedure calls through a RabbitMQ network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important feature of the repository layer is that it always returns domain models, and this is in line with what framework ORMs usually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not deploy a real database in this post. I will address that part of the application in a future post, where there will be enough space to implement two different solutions and show how the repository API can mask the actual implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I am going to create a very simple memory storage system with some predefined data. I think this is enough for the moment to demonstrate the repository concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to write some tests that document the public API of the repository. The file containing the tests is &lt;code&gt;tests/repository/test_memrepo.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we add some data that we will be using in the tests. We import the domain model to check if the results of the API calls have the correct type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared.domain_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;fe2c3195-aeff-487a-a08f-e0bdc0ec6e9a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since the repository object will return domain models, we need a helper function to check the correctness of the results. The following function checks the length of the two lists, ensures that all the returned elements are domain models and compares the codes. Note that we can safely employ the &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function since &lt;code&gt;DomainModel&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract base class and our models are registered (see the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/domain/storagerooms.py&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to initialize the repository with a list of dictionaries, and the &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method without any parameter shall return the same list of entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method shall accept a &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which is a dictionary. The dictionary keys shall be in the form &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;attribute&amp;gt;__&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, similar to the syntax used by the Django ORM. So to express that the price shall be less than 65 we can write &lt;code&gt;filters={'price__lt': 60}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of error conditions shall be checked: using an unknown key shall raise a &lt;code&gt;KeyError&lt;/code&gt; exception, and using a wrong operator shall raise a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt; exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_unknown_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;aname&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_unknown_operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__in&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let us then test that the filtering mechanism actually works. We want the default operator to be &lt;code&gt;__eq&lt;/code&gt;, which means that if we do not put any operator an equality check shall be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__lt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__gt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size__eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size__lt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size__gt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;913694c6-435a-4366-ba0d-da5334a611b2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the &lt;code&gt;MemRepo&lt;/code&gt; class is pretty simple, and I will not dive into it line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;lt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Operator {} is not supported&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__{}__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;The REST layer (part1)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step12"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last step of our journey into the clean architecture. We created the domain models, the serializers, the use cases and the repository. We are actually missing an interface that glues everything together, that is gets the call parameters from the user, initializes a use case with a repository, runs the use case that fetches the domain models from the repository and converts them to a standard format. This layer can be represented by a wide number of interfaces and technologies. For example a command line interface (CLI) can implement exactly those steps, getting the parameters via command line switches, and returning the results as plain text on the console. The same underlying system, however, can be leveraged by a web page that gets the call parameters from a set of widgets, perform the steps described above, and parses the returned JSON data to show the result on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever technology we want to use to interact with the user to collect inputs and provide results we need to interface with the clean architecture we just built, so now we will create a layer to expose an HTTP API. This can be done with a server that exposes a set of HTTP addresses (API endpoints) that once accessed return some data. Such a layer is commonly called a REST layer, because usually the semantic of the addresses comes from the REST recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask is a lightweight web server with a modular structure that provides just the parts that the user needs. In particular, we will not use any database/ORM, since we already implemented our own repository layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this part of the project, together with the repository layer, is usually implemented as a separate package, and I am keeping them together just for the sake of this introductory tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start updating the requirements files. The &lt;code&gt;prod.txt&lt;/code&gt; file shall contain Flask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Flask
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain the &lt;a href="https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Flask-Script extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r test.txt

pip
wheel
flake8
Sphinx
Flask-Script
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain the pytest extension to work with Flask (more on this later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r prod.txt

pytest
tox
coverage
pytest-cov
pytest-flask
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember to run &lt;code&gt;pip install -r requirements/dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; again after those changes to actually install the new packages in your virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup of a Flask application is not complex, but a lot of concepts are involved, and since this is not a tutorial on Flask I will run quickly through these steps. I will however provide links to the Flask documentation for every concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually define different configurations for my testing, development, and production environments. Since the Flask application can be configured using a plain Python object (&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/api/#flask.Config.from_object"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;), I create the file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/settings.py&lt;/code&gt; to host those objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Base configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;APP_DIR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__file__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This directory&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;PROJECT_ROOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;APP_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pardir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProdConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Production configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;prod&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;DevConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Development configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;dev&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TestConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Test configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;test&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;TESTING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/config/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to know more about Flask configuration parameters. Now we need a function that initializes the Flask application (&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/patterns/appfactories/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;), configures it and registers the blueprints (&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/blueprints/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;). The file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/app.py&lt;/code&gt; contains the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.rest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DevConfig&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DevConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register_blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The application endpoints need to return a Flask &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; object, with the actual results and an HTTP status. The content of the response, in this case, is the JSON serialization of the use case response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us write a test step by step, so that you can perfectly understand what is going to happen in the REST endpoint. The basic structure of the test is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[SOME PREPARATION]
[CALL THE API ENDPOINT]
[CHECK RESPONSE DATA]
[CHECK RESPONDSE STATUS CODE]
[CHECK RESPONSE MIMETYPE]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So our first test &lt;code&gt;tests/rest/test_get_storagerooms_list.py&lt;/code&gt; is made of the following parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember that we are not testing the use case here, so we can safely mock it. Here we make the use case return a &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; instance containing a list of domain models (that we didn't define yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the actual API call. We are exposing the endpoint at the &lt;code&gt;/storagerooms&lt;/code&gt; address. Note the use of the &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; fixture provided by &lt;code&gt;pytest-flask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are the three checks previously mentioned. The second and the third ones are pretty straightforward, while the first one needs some explanations. We want to compare &lt;code&gt;http_response.data&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[storageroom1_dict]&lt;/code&gt;, which is a list with a Python dictionary containing the data of the &lt;code&gt;storageroom1_domain_model&lt;/code&gt; object. Flask &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; objects contain a binary representation of the data, so first we decode the bytes using UTF-8, then convert them in a Python object. It is much more convenient to compare Python objects, since pytest can deal with issues like the unordered nature of dictionaries, while this is not possible when comparing two strings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final test file, with the test domain model and its dictionary is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain.storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;3251a5bd-86be-428d-8ae9-6e51a8048c33&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.09998975&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_domain_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_domain_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's time to write the endpoint, where we will finally see all the pieces of the architecture working together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimal Flask endpoint we can put in &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/rest/storageroom.py&lt;/code&gt; is something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;storageroom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@blueprint.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LOGIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first part of our logic is the creation of a &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt;. For the moment we can ignore the optional querystring parameters and use an empty dictionary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see I'm creating the object from an empty dictionary, so querystring parameters are not taken into account for the moment. The second thing to do is to initialize the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third thing the endpoint has to do is the initialization of the use case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally we run the use case passing the request object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This response, however, is not yet an HTTP response, and we have to explicitly build it. The HTTP response will contain the JSON representation of the &lt;code&gt;response.value&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that this function is obviously still incomplete, as it returns always a successful response (code 200). It is however enough to pass the test we wrote. The whole file is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_serializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;storageroom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@blueprint.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This code demonstrates how the clean architecture works in a nutshell. The function we wrote is however not complete, as it doesn't consider querystring parameters and error cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The server in action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step13"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I fix the missing parts of the endpoint let us see the server in action, so we can finally enjoy the product we have been building during this long post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To actually see some results when accessing the endpoint we need to fill the repository with some data. This part is obviously required only because of the ephemeral nature of the repository we are using. A real repository would wrap a persistent source of data and providing data at this point wouldn't be necessary. To initialize the repository we have to define some data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;215&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;fe2c3195-aeff-487a-a08f-e0bdc0ec6e9a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.18228006&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.74640997&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;913694c6-435a-4366-ba0d-da5334a611b2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.27891577&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.45994069&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And them feed them into the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we can run the Flask &lt;code&gt;manage.py&lt;/code&gt; file to check the exposed URLs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python manage.py urls
Rule                     Endpoint               
------------------------------------------------
/static/&amp;lt;path:filename&amp;gt;  static                 
/storagerooms            storageroom.storageroom
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and run the development server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python manage.py server
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you open your browser and navigate to &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/storagerooms"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5000/storagerooms&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the API call results. I recommend installing a formatter extension for the browser to better check the output. If you are using Chrome try &lt;a href="https://github.com/callumlocke/json-formatter"&gt;JSON Formatter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The REST layer (part2)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step14"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step14&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us cover the two missing cases in the endpoint. First I introduce a test to check if the endpoint correctly handles querystring parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_failed_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;test message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SYSTEM_ERROR&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                                              &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;test message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This makes the use case return a failed response and check that the HTTP response contains a formatted version of the error. To make this test pass we have to introduce a proper mapping between domain responses codes and HTTP codes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS_CODES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we need to create the Flask response with the correct code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS_CODES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second and last test is a bit more complex. As before we will mock the use case, but this time we will also patch &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt;. We need in fact to know if the request object is initialized with the correct parameters from the command line. So, step by step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_request_object_initialisation_and_use_with_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, like, beforse, a patch of the use case class that ensures the use case will return a &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The request object will be internally created with &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject.from_dict&lt;/code&gt;, and we want that function to return a known mock object, which is the one we initialized here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.request_objects.StorageRoomListRequestObject&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms?filter_param1=value1&amp;amp;filter_param2=value2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we patch &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; and we assign a known output to the &lt;code&gt;from_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method. Then we call the endpoint with some querystring parameters. What should happen is that the &lt;code&gt;from_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method of the request is called with the filter parameters and that the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method of the use case instance is called with the &lt;code&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;param1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;param2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The endpoint function shall be changed somehow to reflect this new behaviour and to make the test pass. The whole code of the new &lt;code&gt;storageroom()&lt;/code&gt; Flask method is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_serializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS_CODES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that we extract the querystring parameters from the global &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object provided by Flask. Once the querystring parameters are in a dictionary, we just need to create the request object from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's all! Some tests are missing in the REST part, but as I said I just wanted to show a working implementation of a clean architecture and not a fully developed project. I suggest that you try to implement some changes, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another endpoint like the access to a single resource (&lt;code&gt;/storagerooms/&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a different repository, connected to a real DB (you can use &lt;a href="https://sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;, for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement a new querystring parameter, for example the distance from a given point on the map (use &lt;a href="https://github.com/geopy/geopy"&gt;geopy&lt;/a&gt; to easily compute distances)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you develop your code always try to work following the TDD approach. Testability is one of the main features of a clean architecture, so don't ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you decide to use a clean architecture or not, I really hope this post helped you to get a fresh view on software architectures, as happened to me when I first discovered the concepts exemplified here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016-11-15: Two tests contained variables with a wrong name (artist), which came from an initial version of the project. The name did not affect the tests. Added some instructions on the virtual environment and the development requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016-12-12: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Taifu"&gt;Marco Beri&lt;/a&gt; who spotted a typo in the code of step 6, which was already correct in the GitHub repository. He also suggested using the Cookiecutter package by &lt;a href="https://github.com/ardydedase"&gt;Ardy Dedase&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Marco and to Ardy!&lt;/p&gt;

I described the basic behaviour of mock objects, the &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt; attributes, and the &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will briefly review the remaining &lt;code&gt;assert_*&lt;/code&gt; methods and some interesting attributes that allow to check the calls received by the mock object. Then I will introduce and exemplify patching, which is a very important topic in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other assertions and attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; of the mock library lists many other assertion, namely &lt;code&gt;assert_called_once_with()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_any_call()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_has_calls()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_not_called()&lt;/code&gt;. If you grasped how &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; works, you will have no troubles in understanding how those other behave. Be sure to check the documentation to get a full description of what mock object can assert about their history after being used by your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with those methods, mock objects also provide some useful attributes, two of which have been already reviewed in the first post. The remaining attributes are as expected mostly related to calls, and are &lt;code&gt;called&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_count&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_args&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_args_list&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;method_calls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mock_calls&lt;/code&gt;. While these also are very well descripted in the official documentation, I want to point out the two &lt;code&gt;method_calls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mock_calls&lt;/code&gt; attributes, that store the detailed list of methods which are called on the mock, and the &lt;code&gt;call_args_list&lt;/code&gt; attribute that lists the parameters of every call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not forget that methods called on a mock object are mocks themselves, so you may first access the main mock object to get information about the called methods, and then access those methods to get the arguments they received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocks are very simple to introduce in your tests whenever your objects accept classes or instances from outside. In that case, as described, you just have to instantiate the &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; class and pass the resulting object to your system. However, when the external classes instantiated by your library are hardcoded this simple trick does not work. In this case you have no chance to pass a mock object instead of the real one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the case addressed by patching. Patching, in a testing framework, means to replace a globally reachable object with a mock, thus achieving the target of having the code run unmodified, while part of it has been hot swapped, that is, replaced at run time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A warm-up example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start with a very simple example. Patching can be complex to grasp at the beginning so it is better to learn it with trivial code. If you do not have it yet, create the testing environment &lt;code&gt;mockplayground&lt;/code&gt; with the instruction given in the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to develop a simple class that returns information about a given file. The class shall be instantiated with the filename, which can be a relative path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of brevity I will not show you every step of the TDD development of the class. Remember that TDD requires you to write a test and then implement the code, but sometimes this could be too fine grained, so do not use the TDD rules without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests for the initialization of the class are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;fileinfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;relative_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;relative_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can put them into the &lt;code&gt;tests/test_fileinfo.py&lt;/code&gt; file. The code that makes the tests pass could be something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;basename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Up to now I didn't introduce any new feature. Now I want the &lt;code&gt;get_info()&lt;/code&gt; function to return a tuple with the file name, the original path the class was instantiated with, and the absolute path of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You immediately realise that you have an issue in writing the test. There is no way to easily test something as "the absolute path", since the outcome of the function called in the test is supposed to vary with the path of the test itself. Let us write part of the test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;???&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where the '???' string highlights that I cannot put something sensible to test the absolute path of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching is the way to solve this problem. You know that the function will use some code to get the absolute path of the file. So in the scope of the test only you can replace that code with different code and perform the test. Since the replacement code has a known outcome writing the test is now possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching, thus, means to inform Python that in some scope you want a globally accessible module/object replaced by a mock. Let's see how we can use it in our example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest.mock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember that if you are using Python 2 you installed the &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; module with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;, so your import statement becomes &lt;code&gt;form mock import patch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You clearly see the context in which the patching happens, as it is enclosed in a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement. Inside this statement the module &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced by a mock created by the function &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; and called &lt;code&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/code&gt;. We can now give the function a &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; as we did with standard mocks in the first post and run the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that make the test pass is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Obviously to write the test you have to know that you are going to use the &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt; function, so patching is somehow a "less pure" practice in TDD. In pure OOP/TDD you are only concerned with the external behaviour of the object, and not with its internal structure. This example, however, shows that you have to cope with some real world issues, and patching is a clean way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The patching decorator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; function we imported from the &lt;code&gt;unittest.mock&lt;/code&gt; module is very powerful, and can be used as a function decorator as well. When used in this fashion you need to change the decorated function to accept a mock as last argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; decorator works like a big &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement for the whole function. Obviously in this way you replace the target function &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt; in the scope of the whole function. It is then up to you to decide if you need to use &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; as a decorator or in a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Multiple patches&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also patch more that one object. Say for example that we want to change the above test to check that the outcome of the &lt;code&gt;FileInfo.get_info()&lt;/code&gt; method also contains the size of the file. To get the size of a file in Python we may use the &lt;code&gt;os.path.getsize()&lt;/code&gt; function, which returns the size of the file in bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have to patch &lt;code&gt;os.path.getsize&lt;/code&gt; as well, and this can be done with another &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; decorator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.getsize&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please notice that the decorator which is nearest to the function is applied first. Always remember that the decorator syntax with &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut to replace the function with the output of the decorator, so two decorators result in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@decorator1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@decorator2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which is a shorcut for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;decorator1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decorator2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This explains why, in the test code, the function receives first &lt;code&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/code&gt;. The first decorator applied to the function is the patch of &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt;, which appends the mock that we call &lt;code&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/code&gt;. Then the patch of &lt;code&gt;os.path.getsize&lt;/code&gt; is applied and this appends its own mock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that makes the test pass is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can write the above test using two &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statements as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.getsize&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using more than one &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement, however, makes the code difficult to read, in my opinion, so in general I prefer to avoid complex &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; trees if I do not need a limited scope of the patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Patching immutable objects&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widespread version of Python is CPython, which is written, as the name suggests, in C. Part of the standard library is also written in C, while the rest is written in Python itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects (classes, modules, functions, etc) that are implemented in C are shared between interpreters, which is something that you can do embedding the Python interpreter in a C program, for example. This requires those objects to be immutable, so that you cannot alter them at runtime from a single interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of this immutability just check the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conjugate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;#39;int&amp;#39; object attribute &amp;#39;conjugate&amp;#39; is read-only&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I'm trying to replace a method with an integer, which is pointless, but nevertheless shows the issue we are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has this immutability to do with patching? What &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; does is actually to temporarily replace an attibute of an object (method of a class, class of a module, etc), so if that object is immutable the patching action fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical example of this problem is the &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; module, which is also one of the best candidates for patching, since the output of time functions is by definition time-varying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show the problem with a simple class that logs operations. The class is the following (you can put it into a file called &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is pretty simple, but testing this code is problematic, because the &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt; method produces results that depend on the actual execution time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we try to write a test patching &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt; we have a bitter surprise. This is the test code, that you can put in &lt;code&gt;tests/test_logger.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest.mock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;datetime.datetime.now&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;A test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the execution of pytest returns a &lt;code&gt;TypeError: can't set attributes of built-in/extension type 'datetime.datetime'&lt;/code&gt;, which is exactly a problem of immutability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to address this problem, but all of them leverage the fact that, when you import of subclass an immutable object what you get is a "copy" of that is now mutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest example in this case is the module &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; itself. In the &lt;code&gt;test_log&lt;/code&gt; function we try to patch directly the &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt; object, affecting the builtin module &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;. The file &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt;, however, does import &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;, so that this latter becomes a local symbol in the &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; module. This is exactly the key for our patching. Let us change the code to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;logger.datetime.datetime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;A test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you see running the test now the patching works. What we did was to patch &lt;code&gt;logger.datetime.datetime&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt;. Two things changed, thus, in our test. First, we are patching the module imported in the &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt; file and not the module provided globally by the Python interpreter. Second, we have to patch the whole module because this is what is imported by the &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt; file. If you try to patch &lt;code&gt;logger.datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt; you will find that it is still immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible solution to this problem is to create a function that invokes the immutable object and returns its value. This last function can be easily patched, because it just uses the builtin objects and thus is not immutable. This solution, however, requires to change the source code to allow testing, which is far from being desirable. Obviously it is better to introduce a small change in the code and have it tested than to leave it untested, but whenever is possible I avoid solutions that introduce code which wouldn't be required without tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second part of this small series on Python testing we reviewd the patching mechanism and run through some of its subleties. Patching is a really effective technique, and patch-based tests can be found in many different packages. Take your time to become confident with mocks and patching, since they will be one of your main tools while working with Python and any other object-oriented language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I strongly recommend finding some time to read the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; of the mock library.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, you just have to go and change the version number in your install script and save. Oh, right, you also have to open a feature branch, so that you may record the version update in your Git history. Well, easily done. Damn! You forgot to change the version number in the README.md file...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing the version number of a project is not easy. Not only you need to think about the versioning scheme and what part of the version to increase (see &lt;a href="/blog/2013/03/20/versioning-an-underrated-discipline/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for some tips on this matter), but you also need to remember in which files you put the actual version number, and, depending on your workflow, to correctly manage the version control system commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punch&lt;/strong&gt; is a small tool that aims to simplify the latter parts, that is the management of the version number update process. Punch is a young project but the underlying structure should be flexible enough to allow the implementation of advanced usage cases that may arise in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Punch logo" src="/images/punch/icon_400x400.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Features&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in Python, but manages every kind of text file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May implement different versioning schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently supports integer version parts and multiple value integer parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version parts may be explicitly set to given values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same version number can be represented in different ways using Jinja2 templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each managed file may override the global behaviour with custom settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can automatically commit using Git or git-flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May optionally create annotated commits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can simulate the version upgrade and show what is going to happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may install Punch in your virtual environment (or in your system) directly from PyPI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install punch.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and you will have the &lt;code&gt;punch&lt;/code&gt; executable available.&lt;/p&gt;

It is interesting to see how such a remarkable feature has been introduced into the language by a pure Python module. This demonstrates that Python is built in a way that is very open to changes, thanks to its foundations in pure polymorphism based on delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Python programmers overlooked Abstract Base Classes and the classes in the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; module, which are one of the simplest and useful applications of the concept. Sure enough, this is not a feature that you will use every day or that will change the way you are programming in Python. But neither is it something you shall discard before understanding what it brings into the language, and what sort of problems it can solve for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Level 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EAFP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a dynamically-typed object-oriented language strongly based on delegation, so its approach to problems is intrinsically polymorphic. This means that Python deals mostly with the behaviour of objects and not with their structure. The well-known EAFP protocol (it's Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) comes from this approach. This code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;someobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# object is not subscriptable&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;does not check if the object is a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;dictionary&lt;/code&gt; (both would allow the &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt; notation), but if the object can be accessed by key (or index). When you accept a parameter in a function Python does not specify the type (leaving aside type hints) because you are not interestend in accepting a given type or one of its derived types. You are interested in accepting something that provides the methods you will use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behaviour, in an object-oriented environment, is the run-time interface of the object. This is different from the static interface, which is the collection of the methods provided by the object. The run-time interface is the actual interface the object shows when it is used, and this encompasses the methods provided by its class, but also methods provided by parent classes, the metaclass and other entry points provided by &lt;code&gt;__getattr__&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complex checks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, you need to perform complex checks, such as "it behaves like a list". How can you test this condition? You could test if the incoming object has some standard methods, but this is not only incomplete but also wrong. For example, I could write the following test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which tries to cover the methods a list-like object shall provide. This test, however, accepts objects that do not really behave like a list such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fakemethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getattr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;append&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;count&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;extend&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;index&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;insert&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fakemethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that you will write such a class, but this shows you one of the potential pitfalls of the previous test, which is wrong because it tries to rely on the structure instead of testing the behaviour. The temptation to rely on &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; is big&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If possible this approach is worse than before, since it tests the exact type. Even if &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt; are smart enough to walk through the hierarchy of parent classes, this excludes evary class that behaves like a list does not inherit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to delegation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea proposed in &lt;a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/"&gt;PEP 3119&lt;/a&gt; to face this problem is very elegant, and leverages the very nature of Python: that of being strongly based on delegation. The solution, implemented in Python 3 and backported to Python 2.7, changes the nature of the two &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt; builtins. Now the first thing that &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; does is to call the &lt;code&gt;__instancecheck__()&lt;/code&gt; method of the queried class, basically giving it the chance to answer the call with a different algorithm than the standard one. The same happens for &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt;, which becomes &lt;code&gt;__subclasscheck__()&lt;/code&gt;. So the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;someclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;does no more perform a pure external check of the relationship between &lt;code&gt;someclass&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;myclass&lt;/code&gt;. The first thing that &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt; does now is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__subclasscheck__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is very natural because, after all, &lt;code&gt;someclass&lt;/code&gt; is the best source of judgement about being a subclass of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new type of subclass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of delegation-based instance and sublcass checks, Python provides a new type of subclass, and thus a new way to relate classes together. Now a subclass may be a real subclass, obtained using inheritance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChildClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ParentClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or can be a &lt;em&gt;virtual&lt;/em&gt; subclass, obtained through registration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ParentClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ChildClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The difference between a real and a virtual subclass is very simple: a real subclass knows its relationship with the parent class through its &lt;code&gt;__bases__&lt;/code&gt; attribute, and can thus implicitly delegate the resolution of missing methods. A virtual subclass knows nothing about the class that registered it, and nowhere in the subclass will you find something that links it to the parent class. Thus, a virtual parent class is useful only as a categorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract Base Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes that can register other classes, thus becoming virtual parents of those, are called in Python Abstract Base Classes, or ABCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of this new language element is important. ABCs are first of all classes, just like any other class you can create in Python, and they can be subclassed in the usual way to create taxonomies. They are also meant to be base classes, that is classes that represent fundamental behaviours or categories. Last, they are abstract. This has a very precise meaning in Python and will be the subject of the last part of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classes provided by the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; module are Abstract Base Classes, and they set themselves as virtual parents of some base types in the same module. If you check the &lt;code&gt;_collections_abc.py&lt;/code&gt; file in your Python 3 installation (for example in &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/python3.4/_collections_abc.py&lt;/code&gt;) you will find code like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;MutableSequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Where the &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;MutableSequence&lt;/code&gt; ABCs register some built-in types of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand that registering a class does not imply any form of check about methods or attributes. Registering is just the &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; that a given behaviour is provided by the registered class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this let me provide you a very simple example made using one of the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.MyClass&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; class is initially not recognized as a subclass of &lt;code&gt;collections.Sequence&lt;/code&gt;, but after the registration &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, even if the class is still empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot to create ABCs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example given by the official documentation is very simple and clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is to create a class and use the &lt;code&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/code&gt; metaclass provided by the &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; module and you will obtain a class that has the &lt;code&gt;register()&lt;/code&gt; method and a suitable implementation of &lt;code&gt;__subclasscheck__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__instancecheck__()&lt;/code&gt;. Checking again the &lt;code&gt;_collections_abc.py&lt;/code&gt; file you can see that this is exactly the way the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; classes are implemented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Hashable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Are you scared of metaclasses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaclasses are a strange topic in Python. Most of the times the advice given to the novice is "Don't use them", like they were an error of the language and something that shall be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think so. As a matter of facts I definitely disagree with such position, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you are programming in Python its better for you to understand everything Python provides you, both the good and the bad parts. Programming languages are tools, and you shall know their strengths and their limitations. Most of the times what we call "limitations" are just features that become a restraint just because we are not aware of them. The C language, for example, is not object-oriented. Is this a strenght or a limitation? Python provides you a very powerful inspection mechanism. Is this a strength or a limitations? I could give countless other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, powerful features are the one you should know better. After all, we use a language for the unique features it provides, not for the features it shares with other languages. I use Python because of its powerful polymorphism implementation, not because of loops and inheritance. Those are provided by Java and C++, too, for example. I write a device driver in C because of the closeness to the machine language and its speed, not because of the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; types, which are provided by many other languages. So, since powerful features are what let the language do what others cannot, those are the ones you have to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, if a feature of a language is a design error, and it can be, you need to understand why it is an error, and how you can avoid using it. Before ES6, JavaScript had some issues with scopes, given by the behaviour of the &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; keyword. You cannot afford being ignorant about those limitations, otherwise your software will be buggy. So, while studying the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop in JavaScript took me a couple of minutes (it is a C-like for loop, after all), I spent a lot of time in dealing with &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;, which is the dangerous button of the whole device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Python. Metaclasses are not a last-minute feature put into the language just for fun. They are the foundation of Python itself, and the relationship between &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is something so beautiful that it is a pity that basically no one talks about it. So, plase stop complaining against metaclasses and telling people that they are dangerous or complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaclasses are part of the language. And they are not complex to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why metaclasses for ABCs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you program in Python you should be somehow familiar with classes and instances. You know that when you build an instance you usa a class (like a blueprint) and that the class can put things into the instance. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Class definition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Link instance and class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Use the instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, when you build a class you use a metaclass (like a blueprint) and the metaclass can put things into the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Metaclass definition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NewType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Link class and metaclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Use the class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sounds complex? Not at all, in my opinion. If you check the two examples you will see that they are exactly the same thing, the first referring to the instance-class relationship, the second to the class-metaclass one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all you need to understand metaclasses. When you build a class you need to put things into it, for example you need to put the &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; methods. This is done by the metaclass, which is usually &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; for every class. Indeed, if you check the &lt;code&gt;__class__&lt;/code&gt; attribute into a class you get exactly this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Metaclasses and MRO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slightly advanced annotation: when I say that the metaclass &lt;em&gt;puts&lt;/em&gt; the methods into the class I'm simplifiying the whole thing. As a matter of fact, like a class provides methods to the instance at runtime through the &lt;code&gt;__class__&lt;/code&gt; attribute and the MRO protocol, the metaclass provides methods for the class. Attributes, instead, are put inside the class by the &lt;code&gt;__new__&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; methods of the metaclass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us review the MRO mechanism for instances and classes first. When you call a method on an instance Python automatically looks for that method in the instance first, then in the parent class and in every class in its hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GrandParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GrandParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;calling the method &lt;code&gt;get_name()&lt;/code&gt; on an instance of &lt;code&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt; will look for it first into the &lt;code&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt; class, then into &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GrandParent&lt;/code&gt;, in this order. Finally, it will check &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to the MRO when a class of this hierarchy defines a different metaclass? For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NewType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GrandParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GrandParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this case everything works as usual, but after checking &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; the MRO will also check the &lt;code&gt;NewType&lt;/code&gt; metaclass (and its ancestors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, metaclasses can act as mixins, and they are queried only at the end of the usual MRO. This is exactly what happens using multiple inheritance if &lt;code&gt;NewType&lt;/code&gt; were a standard parent class that does not have &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GrandParent&lt;/code&gt; as ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaclasses are not part of the MRO however, since the MRO just deals with standard inheritance. If you check the MRO of the &lt;code&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt; class, you will see that the metaclass is not included&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Child&amp;#39;&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Parent&amp;#39;&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.GrandParent&amp;#39;&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;object&amp;#39;&amp;gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.NewType&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Abstract methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are ABC called &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt;? ABCs can be instantiated, so they are after all not pure interfaces (like Java ones, for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They may however define some methods as &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;, using the &lt;code&gt;abc.abstractmethod&lt;/code&gt; decorator, which prevents the class from being instantiated if the method is not implemented. Let me give you a simple example: I define an Abstract Base Class with and abstract method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metaclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@abc.abstractmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and try to instantiate it. Python complains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;Can&amp;#39;t instantiate abstract class MyABC with abstract methods get&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am forced to create a new class that inherits from &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; and implements the method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Concrete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now I can instantiate the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Concrete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Check the official documentation of Abstract Base Classes for a complete description of &lt;code&gt;@abstractmethod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@abstractproperty&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about the behaviour?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happened to the Python tenet "Check the behaviour and not the structure"? With collections, after all, we dropped the EAFP protocol, going back to a Look Before You Leap approach. Are we going against the philosophy at the very base of the language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very interesting to see what Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python language, says about this in &lt;a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/"&gt;PEP 3119&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Invocation means interacting with an object by invoking its methods. Usually this is combined with polymorphism, so that invoking a given method may run different code depending on the type of an object. Inspection means the ability for external code (outside of the object's methods) to examine the type or properties of that object, and make decisions on how to treat that object based on that information. [...] In classical OOP theory, invocation is the preferred usage pattern, and inspection is actively discouraged, being considered a relic of an earlier, procedural programming style. However, in practice this view is simply too dogmatic and inflexible, and leads to a kind of design rigidity that is very much at odds with the dynamic nature of a language like Python.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the point is that forcing the use of a pure polymorphic approach sometimes can lead to solutions that are too complex or even incorrect. The key words here, in my opinion, are "dogmatic", "inflexible", and "rigidity", opposed to "dynamic nature". I really like this flexibility in a language and in its author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing &lt;code&gt;if isinstance(obj, collections.Sequence)&lt;/code&gt; is not EAFP, neither is any conditional test you may write. Nevertheless, no one would replace conditional tests with a pure EAFP approach, simply because sometimes those tests are more readable. This is the exact purpose of collections in Python and ABCs in general: to allow parts of the code to be simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post helped you understand that Abstract Base Classes, and in particular the standard collections, are useful and easy to understand. Metaclasses are also not that scary and dangerous, even if using them obviously requires some skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official documentation of the &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; module is very well written. &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/abc.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you find the version for Python 3.5. I also suggest to read the original &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119"&gt;PEP 3119&lt;/a&gt; and the realated &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3141"&gt;PEP 3141&lt;/a&gt; for a deeper undestanding of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that you need to isolate a given (external) function that is part of your public API and demonstrate that it works with standard inputs and in edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are going to develop an object that stores percentages (such as for example poll results), you should test the following conditions: the class can store a standard percentage such as 42%, the class shall give an error if you try to store a negative percentage, the class shall give an error if you store a percentage greater than 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests shall be &lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;isolated&lt;/em&gt;. Idempotent in mathematics and computer science identifies a process that can be run multiple times without changing the status of the system. Isolated means that a test shall not change its behaviour depending on previous executions of itself, nor depend on the previous execution (or missing execution) of other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such restrictions, which guarantee that your tests are not passing due to a temporary configuration of the system or the order in which they are run, can raise big issues when dealing with external libraries and systems, or with intrinsically mutable concepts such as time. In the testing discipline, such issues are mostly faced using mocks, that is objects that pretend to be other objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts I am going to review the Python &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; library and exemplify its use. I will not cover everything you may do with mock, obviously, but hopefully I'll give you the information you need to start using this powerful library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; is a Python library which development started around 2008. It was selected to be included in the standard library as of Python 3.3, which however does not prevent you to use other libraries if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3 users, thus, are not required to take any step, while for Python 2 projects you are still required to issue a &lt;code&gt;pip install mock&lt;/code&gt; to install it into the system or the current virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find the official documentation &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is very detailed, and as always I strongly recommend taking your time to run through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mock, in the testing lingo, is an object that simulates the behaviour of another (more complex) object. When you (unit)test an object of your library you need sometimes to access other systems your object want to connect to, but you do not really want to be forced to run them, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is that connecting with external systems means having a complex testing environment, that is you are dropping the isolation requirement of you tests. If your object wants to connect with a website, for example, you are forced to have a running Internet connection, and if the remote website is down you cannot test your library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that the setup of an external system is usually slow in comparison with the speed of unit tests. We expect to run hundred of tests in seconds, and if we have to fetch information from a remote server for each of them the time easily increases by several orders of magnitude. Remember: having slow tests means that you cannot run them while you develop, which in turn means that you will not really use them for TDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third reason is more subtle, and has to to with the mutable nature of an external system, thus I'll postpone the discussion of this issue for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us try and work with a mock in Python and see what it can do. First of all fire up a Python shell or a &lt;a href="http://jupyter.org"&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt; and import the library &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are using Python 2 you have to install it and use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main object that the library provides is &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; and you can instantiate it without any argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This object has the peculiar property of creating methods and attributes on the fly when you require them. Let us first look inside the object to take a glance of what it provides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;#39;assert_any_call&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_once_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_has_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;attach_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args_list&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_count&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;called&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;configure_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;method_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_add_spec&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;reset_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;return_value&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;side_effect&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are some methods which are already defined into the &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; object. Let us read a non-existent attribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;Mock name=&amp;#39;mock.some_attribute&amp;#39; id=&amp;#39;140222043808432&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;#39;assert_any_call&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_once_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_has_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;attach_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args_list&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_count&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;called&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;configure_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;method_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_add_spec&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;reset_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;return_value&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;side_effect&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;some_attribute&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, as you can see this class is somehow different from what you are accustomed to. First of all its instances do not raise an &lt;code&gt;AttributeError&lt;/code&gt; when asked for a non-existent attribute, but they happily return another instance of &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; itself. Second, the attribute you tried to access has now been created inside the object and accessing it returns the same mock object as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;Mock name=&amp;#39;mock.some_attribute&amp;#39; id=&amp;#39;140222043808432&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mock objects are callables, which means that they may act both as attributes and as methods. If you try to call the mock it just returns you another mock with a name that includes parentheses to signal its callable nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;Mock name=&amp;#39;mock.some_attribute()&amp;#39; id=&amp;#39;140247621475856&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can understand, such objects are the perfect tool to mimic other objects or systems, since they may expose any API without raising exceptions. To use them in tests, however, we need them to behave just like the original, which implies returning sensible values or performing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Return value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest thing a mock can do for you is to return a given value every time you call it. This is configured setting the &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; attribute of a mock object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now the object does not return a mock object any more, instead it just returns the static value stored in the &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Obviously you can also store a callable such as a function or an object, and the method will return it, but it will not run it. Let me give you an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;42&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;function print_answer at 0x7f8df1e3f400&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see calling &lt;code&gt;some_attribute()&lt;/code&gt; just returns the value stored in &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt;, that is the function itself. To return values that come from a function we have to use a slightly more complex attribute of mock objects called &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt; parameter of mock objects is a very powerful tool. It accepts three different flavours of objects, callables, iterables, and exceptions, and changes its behaviour accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pass an exception the mock will raise it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;A custom value error&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;902&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;958&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;A custom value error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you pass an iterable, such as for example a generator, or a plain list, tuple, or similar objects, the mock will yield the values of that iterable, i.e. return every value contained in the iterable on subsequent calls of the mock. Let me give you an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;902&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;961&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;StopIteration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As promised, the mock just returns every object found in the iterable (in this case a &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; object) once at a time until the generator is exhausted. According to the iterator protocol (see &lt;a href="/blog/2013/03/25/python-generators-from-iterators-to-cooperative-multitasking/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) once every item has been returned the object raises the &lt;code&gt;StopIteration&lt;/code&gt; exception, which means that you can correctly use it in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last and perhaps most used case is that of passing a callable to &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt;, which shamelessly executes it with its own same parameters. This is very powerful, especially if you stop thinking about "functions" and start considering "callables". Indeed, &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt; also accepts a class and calls it, that is it can instantiate objects. Let us consider a simple example with a function without arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;42&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;       
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A slightly more complex example: a function with arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Number:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print_number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Number: 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally an example with a class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Value:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;__main__.Number object at 0x7f8df1aa4470&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Value: 26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Testing with mocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know how to build a mock and how to give it a static return value or make it call a callable object. It is time to see how to use a mock in a test and what facilities do mocks provide. I'm going to use &lt;a href="http://pytest.org"&gt;pytest&lt;/a&gt; as a testing framework. You can find a quick introduction to pytest and TDD &lt;a href="/categories/tdd/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to quickly setup a pytest playground you may execute this code in a terminal (you need to have Python 3 and virtualenv installed in your system) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mkdir mockplayground
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; mockplayground
virtualenv venv3 -p python3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv3/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pytest
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;[pytest]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; pytest.ini
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;norecursedirs=venv*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; pytest.ini
mkdir tests
touch myobj.py
touch tests/test_mock.py
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; py.test
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable is an easy way to avoid having to setup a whole Python project to just test some simple code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The three test types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sandy Metz we need to test only three types of messages (calls) between objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incoming queries (assertion on result)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incoming commands (assertion on direct public side effects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outgoing commands (expectation on call and arguments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the original talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or read the slides &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skmetz/magic-tricks-of-testing-railsconf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The final table is shown in slide number 176.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see when dealing with external objects we are only interested in knowing IF a method was called and WHAT PARAMETERS the caller passed to the object. We are not testing if the remote object returns the correct result, this is faked by the mock, which indeed returns exactly the result we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the purpose of the methods provided by mock objects is to allow us to check what methods we called on the mock itself and what parameters we used in the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asserting calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how to use Python mocks in testing I will follow the TDD methodology, writing tests first and then writing the code that makes the tests pass. In this post I want to give you a simple overview of the mock objects, so I will not implement a real world use case, and the code will be very trivial. In the second part of this series I will test and implement a real class, in order to show some more interesting use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we are usually interested in when dealing with an external object is to know that a given method has been called on it. Python mocks provide the &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method to check this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case we are going to test is the following. &lt;em&gt;We instantiate the &lt;code&gt;myobj.MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class, which requires an external object. The class shall call the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method of the external object without any parameter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;myobj&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_instantiation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;myobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;myobj.MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class, in this simple example, needs to connect to an external object, for example a remote repository or a database. The only thing we need to know for testing purposes is if the class called the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method of the external object without any parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first thing we do in this test is to instantiate the mock object. This is a fake version of the external object, and its only purpose is to accept calls from the &lt;code&gt;MyObj&lt;/code&gt; object under test and return sensible values. Then we instantiate the &lt;code&gt;MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class passing the external object. We expect the class to call the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method so we express this expectation calling &lt;code&gt;external_obj.connect.assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens behind the scenes? The &lt;code&gt;MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class receives the external object and somewhere is its initialization process calls the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method of the mock object and this creates the method itself as a mock object. This new mock records the parameters used to call it and the subsequent call to &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; checks that the method was called and that no parameters were passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running pytest the test obviously fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; py.test

$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Putting this code in &lt;code&gt;myobj.py&lt;/code&gt; is enough to make the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method actually calls &lt;code&gt;repo.connect()&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; is expected to be a full-featured external object that provides a given API. In this case (for the moment) the API is just its &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method. Calling &lt;code&gt;repo.connect()&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; is a mock object silently creates the method as a mock object, as shown before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method also allows us to check the parameters we passed when calling. To show this let us pretend that we expect the &lt;code&gt;MyObj.setup()&lt;/code&gt; method to call &lt;code&gt;setup(cache=True, max_connections=256)&lt;/code&gt; on the external object. As you can see we pass a couple of arguments (namely &lt;code&gt;cache&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max_connections&lt;/code&gt;) to the called method, and we want to be sure that the call was exactly in this form. The new test is thus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;myobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As usual the first run fails. Be sure to check this, it is part of the TDD methodology. You must have a test that DOES NOT PASS, then write some code that make it pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; py.test

$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To show you what type of check the mock object provides let me implement a partially correct solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the external object has been stored in &lt;code&gt;self._repo&lt;/code&gt; and the call to &lt;code&gt;self._repo.setup()&lt;/code&gt; is not exactly what the test expects, lacking the &lt;code&gt;max_connections&lt;/code&gt; parameter. Running pytest we obtain the following result (I removed most of the pytest output)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;E           AssertionError: Expected call: setup&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;True, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;max_connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;256&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
E           Actual call: setup&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;True&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and you see that the error message is very clear about what we expected and what happened in our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can read in the official documentation, the &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; object also provides the following methods and attributes: &lt;code&gt;assert_called_once_with&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_any_call&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_has_calls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_not_called&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;called&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_count&lt;/code&gt;. Each of them explores a different aspect of the mock behaviour concerning calls, make sure to check their description and the examples provided along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first part of the series I described the behaviour of mock objects and the methods they provide to simulate return values and to test calls. They are a very powerful tool that allows you to avoid creating complex and slow tests that depend on external facilities to run, thus missing the main purpose of tests, which is that of &lt;em&gt;continuously&lt;/em&gt; helping you to check your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next issue of the series I will explore the automatic creation of mock methods from a given object and the very important patching mechanism provided by the &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; decorator and context manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being so committed to this language (both for personal choices and for business reasons) I never stopped learning new languages, trying to get a clear picture of new (or old) paradigms, to explore new solutions to old problems and in general to get my mind open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately introducing a new language in your business is always very risky, expensive and many times not a decision of yours only. You are writing software that other may have to maintain, so either you evangelize your team and persuade other to join you or you will be forced to stay with the languages shared by them. This is not bad in itself, but sometimes it is a big obstacle for the adoption of a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the languages I fell in love (but never used in production) is LISP. I strongly believe that everyone calls themselves a programmer shall be somehow familiar with LISP, as well as with Assembly language. The reasons are many and probably do not fit well with the title of this article so I will save them for another, more theoretical post, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure is a LISP implementation that runs on the JVM, thus being available on a wide number of platforms. As any other LISP its syntax is a step lower in the abstraction tree: while other languages provide their syntax and then a conversion to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), LISPs provide only their AST syntax. This has the great advantage of homoiconicity, something that they share with Assembly and other languages like Prolog, but comes at the cost of a slightly more difficult syntax, at least for the novice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to review the sequential data types provided by Clojure, trying to introduce them to programmers accustomed to Python data types. Anyway, while the nomenclature and the examples will be specific to Python, I think the discussion can be easily extended to other dynamic languages such as Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three collection types for the programming-kings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Clojure, just like in Python, you find three types of basic collection types, that is types of data that hold together other types of data, also called compound data types. These are sequences, sets and maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python provides two types of basic sequences, &lt;strong&gt;tuples&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lists&lt;/strong&gt;, while maps are called &lt;strong&gt;dictionaries&lt;/strong&gt;. Those are present in Python since its first versions. &lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt; have been introduced with Python 2.3 in 2003, at first with a dedicated &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; module, which was then deprecated with Python 2.6 in favour of the built-in type with the same name. From Python 2.7 sets get also a dedicated short syntax similar to that of dictionaries (e.g. &lt;code&gt;{'just', 'a', 'set'&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two basic Python sequences differ mainly for a small but very important detail: mutability. In Python tuples are immutable, while lists can be modified. Python lists behave mostly like C arrays: elements can be appended to and extracted from the right end. Apart from the mutability, Python lists and tuples expose a common API which we may address as the &lt;strong&gt;Python sequence API&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;protocol&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An object that follows the sequence API in Python has the following traits, among the others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements are indexed starting from 0 up to the total number of elements minus 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sequence can be traversed in order, that is, elements can be visited one by one and each repeated visit of the whole collection presents the elements in the same order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A derived feature which is provided by sequences is that they can be sliced, i.e. part of them can be extracted as a collection of the same type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features are paramount because they allow Python to define a common interface for loops. This is obviously shared with mostly every programming language, but Clojure implements it in a slightly different way. A Python class shall implement some "magic" methods to expose the sequence API. To get a starting picture of the steps involved read &lt;a href="/blog/2015/05/13/python-oop-tdd-example-part1/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, where I discuss the implementation of a binary number type in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A matter of definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clojure counterpart of the Python sequence protocol is the &lt;strong&gt;seq API&lt;/strong&gt; and it consists of two simple functions: &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt;. Their behaviour is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the collection is not empty &lt;code&gt;(first collection)&lt;/code&gt; returns the first element, otherwise returns &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the collection is not empty &lt;code&gt;(rest collection)&lt;/code&gt; returns a new sequence containing all the elements of &lt;code&gt;collection&lt;/code&gt; except the first one, in the same order. If the collection is empty &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; returns an empty collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API is the same we can find in functional languages like Erlang or Scala, where most of the loops are implemented as (tail-) recursive function calls that consume the sequence one element at a time, leaving the rest of the sequence to the next recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to an important difference in Clojure's handling of empty sequences, compared to other LISPs and Python itself. While those treat empty sequences as logically false, Clojure doesn't, so be careful when you deal with this part of it coming from a different language. Remember that in Clojure &lt;strong&gt;everything is true except &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the definition of the &lt;em&gt;seq&lt;/em&gt; API, in Clojure we call &lt;strong&gt;sequence&lt;/strong&gt; everything behaves according to it. Since Clojure is implemented on the JVM this "behaviour" matches a very specific Java interface, which in this case is &lt;code&gt;ISeq&lt;/code&gt; (see the source definition &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/ISeq.java"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of being an ordered set of values in Clojure is represented by the word &lt;strong&gt;sequential&lt;/strong&gt;, which corresponds to the Java interface &lt;code&gt;Sequential&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Sequential.java"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;). Last, the concept of being a &lt;strong&gt;collection&lt;/strong&gt; is represented in Clojure by means of the Java interface &lt;code&gt;IPersistenCollection&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/IPersistentCollection.java"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these definitions it is immediately clear what difference is there between the &lt;code&gt;seq?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sequential?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;coll?&lt;/code&gt; functions. They tell you if the given parameter implements the relative Java interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;, instead, performs a conversion of its input into a sequence, that is something that implements the &lt;code&gt;ISeq&lt;/code&gt; interface. This function always returns &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; if the input is an empty collection, which allows Clojure to adhere to the standard LISP technique called &lt;em&gt;nil-punning&lt;/em&gt;, or in simpler words &lt;strong&gt;loop termination condition check&lt;/strong&gt;. Every collection in Clojure provides a meaningful output for the &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; function, but some of them provide more than one function to return a sequence. For example maps provide a way to get the sequence of both keys and values through the aptly named &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vals&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vectors and lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure provides two sequential data types just like Python, but they do not differ for the mutability property, because in Clojure every collection is immutable. Instead, they differ for their behaviour as queues (where a new element goes and where a popped element comes from).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two data types are vectors and lists, and as happens in other LISPs lists are very important for the language syntax itself. Their main difference between the two types, which is immediately clear when using them, is that while vectors grow on the right end, lists grow on the left one. This will be important when discussing append functions like &lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first start with some details on mutability and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mutability and persistence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure's collections are &lt;strong&gt;immutable&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that you cannot change the content of one of their instances. This is a feature provided in Python by means of the tuple data type only. As happens in other languages like Erlang, Clojure's immutability of collections is a trampoline to concurrency safety, something the language provides as a feature rather than a limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure collections are also &lt;strong&gt;persistent&lt;/strong&gt;. The original meaning of this word refers to the possibility of accessing the old version of a given structure after having changed it. Since structures in Clojure are immutable you are forced to create a new variable every time you want to change something, which implies that the "old version" is still available. That is, immutability implies persistence. In Clojure, moreover, structures share values as long as this is consistent, which is exactly what Python does with the references concept (see &lt;a href="/blog/2014/08/21/python-3-oop-part-4-polymorphism"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vectors in Clojure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure's vectors are very similar to Python lists. The first thing that makes them similar (apart from the square brackets syntax) is that they grow on the right end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;conj &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the right end you can also easily get values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;peek &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So Clojure vectors and Python lists are LIFO queues (Last In First Out), otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;stacks&lt;/em&gt;. In Clojure &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt; takes the role of the classic &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; operation, but remember that being collections immutable, what you get is a new value. That is, while in Python &lt;code&gt;pop()&lt;/code&gt; modifies the list, in Clojure &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt; doesn't alter the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subvectors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Python lists, vectors can be sliced with the &lt;code&gt;subvec&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;subvec &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Subvectors are however different from Python list slices. When you slice a list in Python you get a new object containing part of the same references you can find in the source list. That is, slicing a list actually builds a new list copying the reference of each object contained in the slice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us briefly review this important concept. For this example I build a list of mutable objects, in this case dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[{&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: 2, &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: 1}, {&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 3, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: 4}, {&amp;#39;f&amp;#39;: 6, &amp;#39;e&amp;#39;: 5}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;then take a slice of it, a list containing the second element only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[{&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 3, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: 4}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The original list &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and the slice &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; are different objects, as shown by their memory address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;3069706412&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;3061925100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;but there is still a link between them, as you can see if you change the value of the element contained in the slice. This change affects the original list too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[{&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 100, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: 4}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[{&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: 2, &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: 1}, {&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 100, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: 4}, {&amp;#39;f&amp;#39;: 6, &amp;#39;e&amp;#39;: 5}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Clojure a subvector is a complete reference to the source vector, with a special annotation of the slice boundaries. This gives you a very fast way to create subvectors, which is independent from the size of the vector itself (aka O(1) or constant time). On the other hand this gives you a structure which is a bit slower when accessed, due to the math involved in computing the actual offset. This handicap however does not propagate to subvectors of subvectors, so it can be considered a (little) constant slowdown of every subvector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Appending values (push)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find two different functions that can append values to a Clojure vector, &lt;code&gt;into&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt;, implementing the &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; operation of classic stacks. Clojure is not an object-oriented language, so these functions are not methods of the vector type. Those methods however behave in a different way according to the destination type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;into&lt;/code&gt; function, according to the &lt;a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/into"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;conjoins every item&lt;/em&gt; of the second argument (the &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; collection) into the first argument (the &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; collection). This means that every item of the incoming collection is appended to the destination, according to the way that collection manages the append operation. For example, vectors grow on the right, so performing an &lt;code&gt;into&lt;/code&gt; will append elements on the right end of the vector itself. This means also that &lt;code&gt;into&lt;/code&gt; may be used to convert one type of collection into another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the &lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt; function &lt;em&gt;conjoins the whole second argument&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt; accepts more than two arguments but let's deal with the simpler case now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;conj &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;code&gt;into&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt; relies on the destination type to perform the actual append operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python you can find a similar situation if you consider the two methods &lt;code&gt;extend()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;append()&lt;/code&gt; of lists. The first one expects an argument that exposes the sequential protocol, and pushes into the destination list each of its elements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;append()&lt;/code&gt; pushes into the list the whole argument, just like &lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt; does for vectors in Clojure, and thus is mostly used to append single elements, for example in for loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Getting values (pop)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; operation of classic stacks is also implemented by two different functions, &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;. The first one returns the last element of the vector, being thus the Clojure's equivalent of Python's &lt;code&gt;pop()&lt;/code&gt; as shown in a previous example. Clojure's &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;, instead, removes the last element and returns the resulting vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pop &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Python equivalent could be a slice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; function will return the same value as &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt;, but is very inefficient for vectors. The &lt;a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; gives an example for a vector of ten thousand elements where &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; is around 25 times slower than &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt;. This is mainly due to the fact that &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; scans the whole sequence to find the last element, that is works in linear time O(n) (see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/clojure-1.7.0/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L249"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note about looking for values. The Python &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; operator has no direct equivalent for Clojure vectors. Beware that the &lt;code&gt;contains?&lt;/code&gt; function does check the collection keys (indices of the vector) and not the values. The &lt;a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/contains_q"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;contains?&lt;/code&gt; gives some hints about this problem. I strongly suggest you to check them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure vectors and Python lists are both arrays of indexed values, which means that they are optimized for random access. In Python you may just index the list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;list&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;strings&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;of&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where the indexing syntax works also for slices. In Clojure you can use the &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;nth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;vector&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;strings&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For vectors the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; function maps to &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt;, since vectors are after all ordered dictionaries with the position indices as keys. Vectors in Clojure can also be directly used as functions, which aliases the use of &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;vector&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;strings&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Lists in Clojure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Clojure a LISP, lists are of paramount importance and a complete discussion about them will surely span more than a small post on a blog. So in this section I will try to stay focused on the differences with Python lists (and Clojure vectors), rather than give you a complete overview of this incredibly powerful tool. The most important thing I will not review here is that lists in Clojure are part of the syntax itself and in the following section I will only consider lists as data containers. The fact that LISPs consider code as data is outside the scope of this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vectors the Clojure collection that implement classic stacks (LIFO queues), and being stacks one of the most used data structures in computer science, it is no surprise that a lot of sequential data processing in Clojure is done through vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already stated the big difference between vectors and lists in Clojure is the fact that lists grow on the left end. Let us review the behaviour of &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;conj&lt;/code&gt; on lists compared to that of the same functions on vectors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;peek &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;peek &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;conj &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;conj &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pop &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pop &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is simple to remember and easy to deal with in algorithms. As you can see lists behave somehow like mirrored vectors. Beware, however, that functions such as &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; still work in the same way. That is, lists are not reversed vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As happened for vectors there are some performance considerations to do for lists. Even for lists the &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; function performs in linear time, but while vectors can use &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt; to perform the same service, lists cannot. This is a big asymmetry and one of the reasons you could prefer vectors over lists for your data. While accessing the first element is blazing fast both for lists and vectors, accessing the last can be very fast for vectors through the &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt; function but is performed in linear time on lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks of Clojure lists used like arrays is that they are not optimized for random access, while vectors are. That is, the &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt; function performs in linear time on lists since, just like &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt;, it scans the whole list one element at a time. Vectors, on the other hand, are indexed, which means that random access is performed in constant time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see there is not much to say about Clojure lists as data containers (here &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; is used more in a Python sense): there are simply very few reasons to prefer lists over vectors as data containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python and Clojure are very different languages, so this was not an attempt to find "migration rules" from Python code to Clojure. I just wanted to review what Python programmers shall expect from Clojure sequential data types, expressing it in a familiar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you a happy Clojure time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third installment of this little series of posts about Python 2.x OOP implementation. The &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/05/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-1"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/10/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-2"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; issues introduced the most important concepts at the basis of Python as an object-oriented language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will continue the discussion about metaclasses, introducing Abstract Base Classes, and give some insights on callable objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post refers to the internals of Python 2.x - please note that Python 3.x changes (improves!) some of the features shown here. You can find the &lt;strong&gt;updated version&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/categories/python3/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Inspection Club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, Python leverages polymorphism at its maximum by dealing only with generic references to objects. This makes OOP not an addition to the language but part of its structure from the ground up. Moreover, Python pushes the EAFP appoach, which tries to avoid direct inspection of objects as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is however very interesting to read what Guido van Rossum says in &lt;a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/"&gt;PEP 3119&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Invocation means interacting with an object by invoking its methods. Usually this is combined with polymorphism, so that invoking a given method may run different code depending on the type of an object. Inspection means the ability for external code (outside of the object's methods) to examine the type or properties of that object, and make decisions on how to treat that object based on that information. [...] In classical OOP theory, invocation is the preferred usage pattern, and inspection is actively discouraged, being considered a relic of an earlier, procedural programming style. However, in practice this view is simply too dogmatic and inflexible, and leads to a kind of design rigidity that is very much at odds with the dynamic nature of a language like Python.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of Python recognizes that forcing the use of a pure polymorphic approach leads sometimes to solutions that are too complex or even incorrect. In this section I want to show some of the problems that can arise from a pure polymorphic approach and introduce Abstract Base Classes, which aim to solve them. I strongly suggest to read &lt;a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/"&gt;PEP 3119&lt;/a&gt; (as for any other PEP) since it contains a deeper and better explanation of the whole matter. Indeed I think that this PEP is so well written that any further explanation is hardly needed. I am however used to write explanations to check how much I understood about the topic, so I am going to try it this time too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;E.A.F.P the Extra Test Trial&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EAFP coding style requires you to trust the incoming objects to provide the attributes and methods you need, and to manage the possible exceptions, if you know how to do it. Sometimes, however, you need to test if the incoming object matches a complex behaviour. For example, you could be interested in testing if the object &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; like a list, but you quickly realize that the amount of methods a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; provides is very big and this could lead to odd EAFP code like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where the methods of the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; type are accessed (not called) just to force the object to raise the &lt;code&gt;AttributeError&lt;/code&gt; exception if they are not present. This code, however, is not only ugly but also wrong. If you recall the "Enter the Composition" section of the &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/05/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-1"&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;, you know that in Python you can always customize the &lt;code&gt;__getattr__()&lt;/code&gt; method, which is called whenever the requested attribute is not found in the object. So I could write a class that passes the test but actually does not act like a list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fakemethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getattr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;append&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;count&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;extend&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;index&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;insert&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fakemethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is obviously just an example, and no one will ever write such a class, but this demonstrates that just accessing methods does not guarantee that a class &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; like the one we are expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many examples that could be done leveraging the highly dynamic nature of Python and its rich object model. I would summarize them by saying that sometimes you'd better to check the type of the incoming object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python you can obtain the type of an object using the &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function, but to check it you'd better use &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a boolean value. Let us see an example before moving on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EnhancedDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EnhancedDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EnhancedDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the function can also walk the class hierarchy, so the check is not so trivial like the one you would obtain by directly using &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; function, however, does not completely solve the problem. If we write a class that actually &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; like a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; but does not inherit from it, &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; does not recognize the fact that the two may be considered the same thing. The following code returns &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; regardless the content of the &lt;code&gt;MyList&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;since &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; does not check the content of the class or its behaviour, it just consider the class and its ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, thus, may be summed up with the following question: what is the best way to test that an object exposes a given interface? Here, the word &lt;em&gt;interface&lt;/em&gt; is used for its natural meaning, without any reference to other programming solutions, which however address the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to address the problem could be to write inside an attribute of the object the list of interfaces it promises to implement, and to agree that any time we want to test the behaviour of an object we simply have to check the content of this attribute. This is exactly the path followed by Python, and it is very important to understand that the whole system is just about a promised behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution proposed through PEP 3119 is, in my opinion, very simple and elegant, and it perfectly fits the nature of Python, where things are usually agreed rather than being enforced. Not only, the solution follows the spirit of polymorphism, where information is provided by the object itself and not extracted by the calling code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next sections I am going to try and describe this solution in its main building blocks. The matter is complex so my explanation will lack some details: please refer to the forementioned PEP 3119 for a complete description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Who Framed the Metaclasses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already described, Python provides two built-ins to inspect objects and classes, which are &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt; and it would be desirable that a solution to the inspection problem allows the programmer to go on with using those two functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we need to find a way to inject the "behaviour promise" into both classes and instances. This is the reason why metaclasses come in play. If you recall what we said about them in the second issue of this series, metaclasses are the classes used to build classes, which means that they are the preferred way to change the structure of a class, and, in consequence, of its instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to do the same job would be to leverage the inheritance mechanism, injecting the behaviour through a dedicated parent class. This solution has many downsides, which I'm am not going to detail. It is enough to say that affecting the class hierarchy may lead to complex situations or subtle bugs. Metaclasses may provide here a different entry point for the introduction of a "virtual base class" (as PEP 3119 specifies, this is not the same concept as in C++).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overriding Places&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said, &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt; are built-in functions, not object methods, so we cannot simply override them providing a different implementation in a given class. So the first part of the solution is to change the behaviour of those two functions to first check if the class or the instance contain a special method, which is &lt;code&gt;__instancecheck__()&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__subclasscheck__()&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt;. So both built-ins try to run the respective special method, reverting to the standard algorithm if it is not present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about naming. Methods must accept the object they belong to as the first argument, so the two special methods shall have the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__instancecheck__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__subclasscheck__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt; is the class where they are injected, that is the one representing the promised behaviour. The two built-ins, however, have a reversed argument order, where the behaviour comes after the tested object: when you write &lt;code&gt;isinstance([], list)&lt;/code&gt; you want to check if the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; instance has the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; behaviour. This is the reason behind the name choice: just calling the methods &lt;code&gt;__isinstance__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__issubclass__()&lt;/code&gt; and passing arguments in a reversed order would have been confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;This is ABC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solution is thus called Abstract Base Classes, as it provides a way to attach to a concrete class a virtual class with the only purpose of signaling a promised behaviour to anyone inspecting it with &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;issubclass()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help programmers implement Abstract Base Classes, the standard library has been given an &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; module, thet contains the &lt;code&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/code&gt; class (and other facilities). This class is the one that implements &lt;code&gt;__instancecheck__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__subclasscheck__()&lt;/code&gt; and shall be used as a metaclass to augment a standard class. This latter will then be able to register other classes as implementation of its behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds complex? An example may clarify the whole matter. The one from the official documentation is rather simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, the &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; class is provided the &lt;code&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/code&gt; metaclass. This puts the two &lt;code&gt;__instancecheck__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__subclasscheck__()&lt;/code&gt; behaviours inside &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt;. Please note however that those methods are not actually put into the object so that you can use them like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__instancecheck__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;that returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; if the dictionary &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of the Abstract Base Class &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt;. In other words if the dictionary &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; implements the behaviour promised by the &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the definition of &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; we need a way to signal that a given class is an instance of the Abstract Base Class and this happens through the &lt;code&gt;register()&lt;/code&gt; method, provided by the &lt;code&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/code&gt; metaclass. Calling &lt;code&gt;MyABC.register(tuple)&lt;/code&gt; we record inside &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; the fact that the &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; class shall be identified as a subclass of &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; itself. This is analogous to saying that &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; inherits from &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; but not quite the same. As already said registering a class in an Abstract Base Class with &lt;code&gt;register()&lt;/code&gt; does not affect the class hierarchy. Indeed, the whole &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; class is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Little Shop of Collections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; module, the standard library now provides a &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; module that, besides some interesting container datatypes like &lt;code&gt;namedtuple&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OrderedDict&lt;/code&gt;, supplies a remarkable number of ABCs that represent container behaviours. An example is &lt;code&gt;collections.Sized&lt;/code&gt; that pledges that the registered class will contain the &lt;code&gt;__len__()&lt;/code&gt; method, enabling the code to pass it to the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; builtin. Let us exemplify that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Snake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;meters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;meters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__len__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Snake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Snake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Snake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If not stressed enough, ABCs assure that a given behaviour will be implemented but there is no actual check of this. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeSnake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;meters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FakeSnake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;issubclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FakeSnake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FakeSnake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;TypeError: object of type &amp;#39;FakeSnake&amp;#39; has no len()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember that ABCs are classes just like any other standard Python class, which means that they can be inherited to build more specialized ABCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Naked Class&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; module provides two decorators &lt;code&gt;@abstractmethod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@abstractproperty&lt;/code&gt; to help the design of Abstract Base Classes. The first decorator, &lt;code&gt;@abstractmethod&lt;/code&gt;, may only be used in a class which metaclass is &lt;code&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/code&gt; (just like the example &lt;code&gt;MyABC&lt;/code&gt; class described above). Decorating a method with it blocks the instantiation of the class itself until that method is overridden. That enables to write classes that may inherited only if the child class provides an implementation of some specific methods. The &lt;code&gt;@abstractproperty&lt;/code&gt; decorator provides the same service for properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us run through a very simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AbstractCalculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@abc.abstractmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@abc.abstractmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;mutiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a class with &lt;code&gt;ABCMeta&lt;/code&gt; as its metaclass, which makes &lt;code&gt;AbstractCalculator&lt;/code&gt; an Abstract Base Class. The two &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;multiply()&lt;/code&gt; methods are decorated with &lt;code&gt;@abstractmethod&lt;/code&gt;, that raises an exception when we try to instance the class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ac&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractCalculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;TypeError: Can&amp;#39;t instantiate abstract class AbstractCalculator with abstract methods mutiply, sum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Moreover, any class that derives from &lt;code&gt;AbstractCalculator&lt;/code&gt; and does not override the two methods (implementing them), cannot be instantiated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractCalculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;TypeError: Can&amp;#39;t instantiate abstract class Calculator with abstract methods mutiply, sum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These two decorators are the standard way to enforce a check about a behaviour or an interface, and are the closest thing to a "strict interface check".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Fish Called Object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first post, when I discussed for the first time the concept of instantiation, I stated that an instance of a class may be obtained by calling the class itself just like a function. Let me recall you the example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Later, speaking about methods and attributes, I defined &lt;em&gt;callable&lt;/em&gt; something that can be invoked with that syntax. Thus, we can now say that classes are callables, just like methods. What makes an object callable, anyway? It turns out that, as many other things in Python, the solution is pretty straightforward: an object is callable if it contains the &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; method. Simple, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we execute a syntax like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Python executes under the hood the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where any parameter passed to the class is obviously passed to &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For standard classes the &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; method is provided by &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, which is the standard metaclass. So when we write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;python actually executes this code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This standard implementation of &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; runs the constructor mechanism as depicted in the second post, executing &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; to get a new instance and initialize it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of callable object is very powerful, since it allows to flatten the difference between classes and functions. In OOP many times the two are presented as two completely separated concepts, but in Python it is usually more convenient to talk about callables. Here, Python shows its polymorphic nature at its maximum: if I expect a function and what is given to me is something that acts like a function everything is fine. Functions, however, are themselves simple callable objects. Remember: in Python everything is an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; is a method we can redefine it in any class, let us try and see what happens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CallMe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Class instances usually contain no definition of &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; and the implementation provided in the class hierarchy prevents them from being called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;TypeError: &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; object is not callable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nothing forbids us to define a custom &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; method inside the instance and make it callable. This allows us to pass the instance where Python expects a function or, better, a callable. A classical example is the &lt;code&gt;sort()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; objects, which accepts an optional callable &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; that shall compare objects. Here, a callable instance is accepted just like a plain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot to say about Python OOP. Just to name one topic, functions are a very interesting and wide subject. I would prefer now to update the current material to Python 3, so this is the last post in this small series.

&lt;p&gt;This post continues the analysis of the Python OOP implementation started with &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/05/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-1"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend reading before taking on this new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second post discusses the following OOP features in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes and instances (again)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metaclasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post refers to the internals of Python 2.x - please note that Python 3.x changes (improves!) some of the features shown here. You can find the &lt;strong&gt;updated version&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/categories/python3/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Morning, Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;, in the OOP lingo, refers to the ability of an object to adapt the code to the type of the data it is processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism has two major applications in an OOP language. The first is that an object may provide different implementations of one of its methods depending on the type of the input parameters. The second is that code written for a given type of data may be used on data with a derived type, i.e. methods understand the class hierarchy of a type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python polymorphism is one of the key concepts, and we can say that it is a built-in feature. Let us deal with it step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you know that in Python the type of a variable is not explicitly declared. Beware that this does not mean that Python variables are &lt;em&gt;untyped&lt;/em&gt;. On the contrary, everything in Python has a type, it just happens that the type is implicitly assigned. If you remember the last paragraph of the previous post, I stated that in Python variables are just pointers (using a C-like nomenclature), in other words they just tell the language &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; in memory a variable has been stored. What is stored at that address is not a business of the variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x89812b0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;five&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;five&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;str&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0xb74bb280L&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This little example shows a lot about the Python typing system. The variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not statically declared, after all it can contain only one type of data: a memory address. When we assign the number 5 to it, Python stores in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;em&gt;address&lt;/em&gt; of the number 5 (&lt;code&gt;0x89812b0&lt;/code&gt; in my case, but your result will be different). The &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function is smart enough to understand that we are not asking about the type of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; (which is always a reference), but about the type of the content. When you store another value in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, the string &lt;code&gt;"five"&lt;/code&gt;, Python shamelessly replaces the previous content of the variable with the new address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thanks to the reference system, Python type system is both &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt;. The exact definition of those two concepts is not universal, so if you are interested be ready to dive into a broad matter. However, in Python, the meaning of those two words is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type system is &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; because everything has a well-defined type, that you can check with the &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; built-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type system is &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; since the type of a variable is not explicitly declared, but changes with the content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward! We just scratched the surface of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the subject a little more, try to define the simplest function in Python (apart from an empty function)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward, isn't it? Well, if you come from a statically compiled language such as C or C++ you should be at least puzzled. What is &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;? I mean: what type of data does it contain? Moreover, how can Python know what it is returning if there is no type specification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if you recall the references stuff everything becomes clear: that function accepts a reference and returns a reference. In other words we just defined a sort of universal function, that does the same thing regardless of the input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the problem that polymorphism wants to solve. We want to describe an action regardless of the type of objects, and this is what we do when we talk among humans. When you describe how to move an object by pushing it, you may explain it using a box, but you expect the person you are addressing to be able to repeat the action even if you need to move a pen, or a book, or a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main strategies you can apply to get code that performs the same operation regardless of the input types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach is to cover all cases, and this is a typical approach of procedural languages. If you need to sum two numbers that can be integers, float or complex, you just need to write three &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; functions, one bound to the integer type, the second bound to the float type and the third bound to the complex type, and to have some language feature that takes charge of choosing the correct implementation depending on the input type. This logic can be implemented by a compiler (if the language is statically typed) or by a runtime environment (if the language is dynamically typed) and is the approach chosen by C++. The disadvantage of this solution is that it requires the programmer to forecast all the possible situations: what if I need to sum an integer with a float? What if I need to sum two lists? (Please note that C++ is not so poorly designed, and the operator overloading technique allows to manage such cases, but the base polymorphism strategy of that language is the one exposed here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second strategy, the one implemented by Python, is simply to require the input objects to solve the problem for you. In other words you &lt;em&gt;ask the data itself to perform the operation&lt;/em&gt;, reversing the problem. Instead of writing a bunch on functions that sum all the possible types in every possible combination you just write one function that requires the input data to sum, trusting that they know how to do it. Does it sound complex? It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the Python implementation of the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator. When we write &lt;code&gt;c = a + b&lt;/code&gt;, Python actually executes &lt;code&gt;c = a.__add__(b)&lt;/code&gt;. As you can see the sum operation is delegated to the first input variable. So if we write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;there is no need to specify the type of the two input variables. The object &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; (the object contained in the variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;) shall be able to sum with the object &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. This is a very beautiful and simple implementation of the polymorphism concept. Python functions are polymorphic simply because they accept everything and trust the input data to be able to perform some actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider another simple example before moving on. The built-in &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function returns the length of the input object. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Just a sentence&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see it is perfectly polymorphic: you can feed both a list or a string to it and it just computes its length. Does it work with any type? let's check&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;TypeError: object of type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; has no len()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ouch! Seems that the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function is smart enough to deal with dictionaries, but not with integers. Well, after all, the length of an integer is not defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed this is exactly the point of Python polymorphism: &lt;em&gt;the integer type does not define a length operation&lt;/em&gt;. While you blame the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function, the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type is at fault. The &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function just calls the &lt;code&gt;__len__()&lt;/code&gt; method of the input object, as you can see from this code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__len__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__len__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__len__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__len__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;AttributeError: &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; object has no attribute &amp;#39;__len__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;but the &lt;code&gt;'int' object&lt;/code&gt; does not define any &lt;code&gt;__len__()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up what we discovered until here, I would say that &lt;em&gt;Python polymorphism is based on delegation&lt;/em&gt;. In the following sections we will talk about the &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-eafp"&gt;EAFP&lt;/a&gt; Python principle, and you will see that the delegation principle is somehow ubiquitous in this language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Type Hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another real-life concept that polymorphism wants to bring into a programming language is the ability to walk the class hierarchy, that is &lt;em&gt;to run code on specialized types&lt;/em&gt;. This is a complex sentence to say something we are used to do every day, and an example will clarify the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how to open a door, it is something you learned in your early years. Under an OOP point of view you are an object (sorry, no humiliation intended) which is capable of interacting with a wood rectangle rotating on hinges. When you can open a door, however, you can also open a window, which, after all, is a specialized type of wood-rectangle-with-hinges, hopefully with some glass in it too. You are also able to open the car door, which is also a specialized type (this one is a mix between a standard door and a window). This shows that, once you know how to interact with the most generic type (basic door) you can also interact with specialized types (window, car door) as soon as they act like the ancestor type (e.g. as soon as they rotate on hinges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directly translates into OOP languages: polymorphism requires that &lt;em&gt;code written for a given type may also be run on derived types&lt;/em&gt;. For example, a list (a generic list object, not a Python one) that can contain "numbers" shall be able to accept integers because they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; numbers. The list could specify an ordering operation which requires the numbers to be able to compare each other. So, as soon as integers specify a way to compare each other they can be inserted into the list and ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statically compiled languages shall provide specific language features to implement this part of the polymorphism concept. In C++, for example, the language needs to introduce the concept of pointer compatibility between parent and child classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python there is no need to provide special language features to implement subtype polymorphism. As we already discovered Python functions accept any variable without checking the type and rely on the variable itself to provide the correct methods. But you already know that a subtype must provide the methods of the parent type, either redefining them or through implicit delegation, so as you can see Python implements subtype polymorphism from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the most important things to understand when working with this language. Python is not really interested in the actual type of the variables you are working with. It is interested in how those variables act, that is it just wants the variable &lt;em&gt;to provide the right methods&lt;/em&gt;. So, if you come from statically typed languages, you need to make a special effort to think about &lt;em&gt;acting like&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;. This is what we called "duck typing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to do an example. Let us define a &lt;code&gt;Room&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A very simple class, as you can see, just enough to exemplify polymorphism. The &lt;code&gt;Room&lt;/code&gt; class accepts a &lt;code&gt;door&lt;/code&gt; variable, and the type of this variable is not specified. Duck typing in action: the actual type of &lt;code&gt;door&lt;/code&gt; is not declared, there is no "acceptance test" built in the language. Indeed, the incoming variable shall export the following methods that are used in the &lt;code&gt;Room&lt;/code&gt; class: &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;is_open()&lt;/code&gt;. So we can build the following classes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;closed&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;closed&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;BooleanDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both represent a door that can be open or closed, and they implement the concept in two different ways: the first class relies on strings, while the second leverages booleans. Despite &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; two different types, both &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; the same way, so both can be used to build a &lt;code&gt;Room&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_door&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BooleanDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_room&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bool_room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;File Like Us&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File-like objects are a concrete and very useful example of polymorphism in Python. A file-like object is a class (or the instance of a class) that acts like a file, i.e. it provides those methods a file object exposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say for example that you code a class that parses an XML tree, and that you expect the XML code to be contained in a file. So your class accepts a file in its &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method, and reads the content from it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;XMLReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xmlfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;xmlfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xmlfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;xmlfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The class works well until your application shall be modified to receive XML content from a network stream. To use the class without modifying it you shall write the stream in a temporary file and load this latter, but this sounds a little overkill. So you plan to change the class to accept a string, but this way you shall change every single code that uses the class to read a file, since now you shall open, read and close the file on your own, outside the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism offers a better way. Why not store the incoming stream inside an object that &lt;em&gt;acts like&lt;/em&gt; a file, even if it is not an actual one? If you check the StringIO module you will find that such an object has been already invented and provided in the standard Python library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other very useful file-like classes are those contained in the &lt;code&gt;gzip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bz2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;zipfile&lt;/code&gt; modules (just to name some of the most used), which provide objects that allow you to manage compressed files just like plain files, hiding the decompression/compression machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unforgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EAFP is a Python acronym that stands for &lt;em&gt;easier to ask for forgiveness than permission&lt;/em&gt;. This coding style is highly pushed in the Python community because it completely relies on the duck typing concept, thus fitting well with the language philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept behind EAFP is fairly easy: instead of checking if an object has a given attribute or method before actually accessing or using it, just trust the object to provide what you need and manage the error case. This can be probably better understood by looking at some code. According to EAFP, instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hasattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;you shall write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;someobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the second snippet directly uses the method and deals with the possible &lt;code&gt;AttributeError&lt;/code&gt; exception (by the way: managing exceptions is one of the top Black Magic Topics in Python, more on it in a future post. A very quick preview: I think we may learn something from Erlang - check &lt;a href="/blog/2013/05/30/error-handling-in-erlang-a-primer/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this coding style pushed so much in the Python community? I think the main reason is that through EAFP you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; polymorphically: you are not interested in knowing if the object &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; attribute, you are interested in knowing if the object can satisfy your request, that is to perform the &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; method call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intermezzo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you still with me? Good. Now go, make yourself a cup of tea and fasten belts: the Python roller coaster is about to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will leave the polymorphism palace for a while to explore other parts of the Python OOP world. Don't worry, however, it is just to lay some foundation before diving another time into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Type Brothers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step into the most intimate secrets of Python objects comes from two components we already met in the first post: &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;. These two things are the very fundamental elements of Python OOP system, so it is worth spending some time to understand how they work and relate each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all recall that in Python &lt;em&gt;everything is an object&lt;/em&gt;, that is everything inherits from &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; seems to be the deepest thing you can find digging into Python variables. Let's check this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bases__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;(&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;object&amp;#39;&amp;gt;,)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bases__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; class, and this latter inherits from &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;, which inherits from nothing. This demonstrates that &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; is at the top of the class hierarchy. However, as you can see, both &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; are called &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;type 'int'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;type 'object'&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which in Python is a pure alias of the word &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, while &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; class, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; itself is an instance of another class, &lt;em&gt;a class that is instanced to build classes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since in Python everything is an object, everything is the instance of a class, even classes. Well, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is the class that is instanced to get classes. So remember this: &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; is the base of every object, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is the class of every type. Sounds puzzling? It is not your fault, don't worry. However, just to strike you with the finishing move, this is what Python is built on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bases__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;(&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;object&amp;#39;&amp;gt;,)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are not about to faint at this point chances are that you are Guido van Rossum of one of his friends down at the Python core development team (in this case let me thank you for your beautiful creation). You may get another cup of tea, if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokes apart, at the very base of Python type system there are two things, &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, which are inseparable. The previous code shows that &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; inherits from &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;. Take your time to understand this subtle concept, as it is very important for the upcoming discussion about metaclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think you grasped the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; matter read this and start thinking again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hint: type is a class (i.e. a type). =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Metaclasses Take Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are now familiar with Python classes. You know that a class is used to create an instance, and that the structure of this latter is ruled by the source class and all its parent classes (until you reach &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since classes are objects too, you know that a class itself is an instance of a (super)class, and this class is &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;. That is, as already stated, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is the class that is used to build classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example you know that a class may be instanced, i.e. it can be called and by calling it you obtain another object that is linked with the class. What prepares the class for being called? What gives the class all its methods? In Python the class in charge of performing such tasks is called &lt;em&gt;metaclass&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is the default metaclass of all classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of exposing this structure of Python objects is that you may change the way classes are built. As you know, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is an object, so it can be subclassed just like any other class. Once you get a subclass of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; you need to instruct your class to use it as the metaclass instead of type, and you can do this by setting the &lt;code&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MySpecialClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyType&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MySpecialClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.MySpecialClass&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MySpecialClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.MyType&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Metaclasses 2: Singleton Day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaclasses are a very advanced topic in Python, but they have many practical uses. For example, by means of a custom metaclass you may log any time a class is instanced, which can be important for applications that shall keep a low memory usage or have to monitor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to show here a very simple example of metaclass, the Singleton. Singleton is a well known design pattern, and many description of it may be found on the Internet. It has also been heavily criticized mostly because its bad behaviour when subclassed, but here I do not want to introduce it for its technological value, but for its simplicity (so please do not question the choice, it is just an example). Check the links at the bottom if you are interested in this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singleton has one purpose: to return the same instance every time it is instanced, like a sort of object-oriented global variable. So we need to build a class that does not work like standard classes, which return a new instance every time they are called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Build a class"? This is a task for metaclasses. The following implementation comes from &lt;a href="http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Metaprogramming.html#intercepting-class-creation"&gt;Python 3 Patterns, Recipes and Idioms&lt;/a&gt;, but is also valid for Python 2.x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are defining a new type, which inherits from &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; to provide all bells and whistles of Python classes. We override the &lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt; method, that is a special method invoked when we call the class, i.e. when we instance it. The new method wraps the original method of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; by calling it only when the &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt; attribute is not set, i.e. the first time the class is instanced, otherwise it just returns the recorded instance. As you can see this is a very basic cache class, the only trick is that it is applied to the creation of instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the new type we need to define a new class that uses it as its metaclass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ASingleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ASingleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ASingleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0xb6aae28cL&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0xb6aae28cL&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By using the &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator we test that the two objects are the very same structure in memory, that is their ids are the same, as explicitly shown. What actually happens is that when you issue &lt;code&gt;a = ASingleton()&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;ASingleton&lt;/code&gt; class runs its &lt;code&gt;__call__()&lt;/code&gt; method, which is taken from the &lt;code&gt;Singleton&lt;/code&gt; type behind the class. That method recognizes that no instance has been created (&lt;code&gt;Singleton.instance&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;) and acts just like any standard class does. When you issue &lt;code&gt;b = ASingleton()&lt;/code&gt; the very same things happen, but since &lt;code&gt;Singleton.instance&lt;/code&gt; is now different from &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; its value (the previous instance) is directly returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaclasses are a very powerful programming tool and leveraging them you can achieve very complex behaviours with a small effort. Their use is a must every time you are actually metaprogramming, that is you are writing code that has to drive the way your code works. Good examples are creational patterns (injecting custom class attributes depending on some configuration), testing, debugging, and performance monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coming to Instance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before introducing you to a very smart use of metaclasses by talking about Abstract Base Classes (read: to save some topics for the third part of this series), I want to dive into the object creation procedure in Python, that is what happens when you instance a class. In the previous post this procedure was described only partially, by looking at the &lt;code&gt;__init_()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first post I recalled the object-oriented concept of &lt;em&gt;constructor&lt;/em&gt;, which is a special method of the class that is automatically called when the instance is created. The class may also define a destructor, which is called when the object is destroyed. In languages without a garbage collection mechanism such as C++ the destructor shall be carefully designed. In Python the destructor may be defined through the &lt;code&gt;__del__()&lt;/code&gt; method, but it is hardly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constructor mechanism in Python is on the contrary very important, and it is implemented by two methods, instead of just one: &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt;. The tasks of the two methods are very clear and distinct: &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; shall perform actions needed when &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; a new instance while &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; deals with object &lt;em&gt;initialization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since in Python you do not need to declare attributes due to its dynamic nature, &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; is rarely defined by programmers, who may rely on &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; to perform the majority of the usual tasks. Typical uses of &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; are very similar to those listed in the previous section, since it allows to trigger some code whenever your class is instanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard way to override &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__new__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__new__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;just like you usually do with &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt;. When your class inherits from &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; you do not need to call the parent method (&lt;code&gt;object.__init__()&lt;/code&gt;) because it is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; is not forced to return an instance of the class in which it is defined, even if you shall have very good reasons to break this behaviour. Anyway, &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; will be called only if you return an instance of the container class. Please also note that &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt;, unlike &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt;, accepts the class as its first parameter. The name is not important in Python, and you can also call it &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, but it is worth using &lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt; to remember that it is not an instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been the leading programming paradigm for several decades now, starting from the initial attempts back in the 60s to some of the most important languages used nowadays. Being a set of programming concepts and design methodologies, OOP can never be said to be "correctly" or "fully" implemented by a language: indeed there are as many implementations as languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the most interesting aspects of OOP languages is to understand how they implement those concepts. In this post I am going to try and start analyzing the OOP implementation of the Python language. Due to the richness of the topic, however, I consider this attempt just like a set of thoughts for Python beginners trying to find their way into this beautiful (and sometimes peculiar) language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first post covers the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects and types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes and instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object members: methods and attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegation: inheritance and composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post refers to the internals of Python 2.x - please note that Python 3.x changes (improves!) some of the features shown here. You can find the &lt;strong&gt;updated version&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/categories/python3/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science deals with data and with procedures to manipulate that data. Everything, from the earliest Fortran programs to the latest mobile apps is about data and their manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if data are the ingredients and procedures are the recipes, it seems (and can be) reasonable to keep them separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do some procedural programming in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is some data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;378&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is a procedure that computes the average&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the procedure is quite good and general: the procedure is run on a sequence of data, and it returns the average of the sequence items. So far, so good: computing the average of some numbers leaves the numbers untouched and creates new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation of the everyday world, however, shows that &lt;em&gt;complex data mutate&lt;/em&gt;: an electrical device is on or off, a door is open or closed, the content of a bookshelf in your room changes as you buy new books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still manage it keeping data and procedures separate, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# These are two numbered doors, initially closed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This procedure opens a door&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open_door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;open_door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I described a door as a structure containing a number and the status of the door. The procedure knows how this structure is made and may alter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also works like a charm. Some problems arise, however, when we start building specialized types of data. What happens, for example, when I introduce a "lockable door" data type, which can be opened only when it is not locked? Let's see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# These are two standard doors, initially closed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is a lockable door, initially closed and unlocked&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ldoor1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;unlocked&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This procedure opens a standard door&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open_door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This procedure opens a lockable door&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open_ldoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;unlocked`:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`open`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;open_door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;open_ldoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ldoor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ldoor1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything still works, no surprises in this code. However, as you can see, I had to find a different name for the procedure that opens a locked door since its implementation differs from the procedure that opens a standard door. But, wait... I'm still opening a door, the action is the same, and it just changes the status of the door itself. So why shall I remember that a locked door shall be opened with &lt;code&gt;open_ldoor()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;open_door()&lt;/code&gt; if the verb is the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that this separation between data and procedures doesn't perfectly fit some situations. The key problem is that the "open" action is not actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the door; rather it is &lt;em&gt;changing its state&lt;/em&gt;. So, just like the volume control buttons of your phone, which are &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your phone, the "open" procedure should stick to the "door" data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what leads to the concept of &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;: an object, in the OOP context, is a structure holding data &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; procedures operating on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About Type?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you talk about data you immediately need to introduce the concept of &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;. This concept may have two meanings that are worth being mentioned in computer science: the &lt;em&gt;behavioural&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavioural meaning represents the fact that you know what something is by describing how it acts. This is the foundation of the so-called "duck typing" (here "typing" means "to give a type" and not "to type on a keyboard"): if it &lt;del&gt;types&lt;/del&gt; acts like a duck, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural meaning identifies the type of something by looking at its internal structure. So two things that act in the same way but are internally different are of different type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both points of view can be valid, and different languages may implement and emphasize one meaning of type or the other, and even both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Class Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects in Python may be built describing their structure through a &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;. A class is the programming representation of a generic object, such as "a book", "a car", "a door": when I talk about "a door" everyone can understand what I'm saying, without the need of referring to a specific door in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, the type of an object is represented by the class used to build the object: that is, in Python the word &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; has the same meaning of the word &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the built-in classes of Python is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, which represents an integer number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the built-in function &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; returns the content of the &lt;em&gt;magic attribute&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;__class__&lt;/code&gt; (magic here means that its value is managed by Python itself offstage). The type of the variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, or its class, is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. (This is a very inaccurate description of this rather complex topic, so remember that we are just scratching the surface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a class you can &lt;em&gt;instantiate&lt;/em&gt; it to get a concrete object (an &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt;) of that type, i.e. an object built according to the structure of that class. The Python syntax to instantiate a class is the same of a function call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;int&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When you create an instance, you can pass some values, according to the class definition, to &lt;em&gt;initialize&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; class creates an integer with value 0 when called without arguments, otherwise it uses the given argument to initialize the newly created object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us write a class that represents a door to match the procedural examples done in the first section&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword defines a new class named &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt;; everything indented under &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; is part of the class. The functions you write inside the object are called &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt; and don't differ at all from standard functions; the name changes only to highlight the fact that those functions now are part of an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods of a class must accept as first argument a special value called &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; (the name is a convention but please never break it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class can be given a special method called &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; which is run when the class is instantiated, receiving the arguments passed when calling the class; the general name of such a method, in the OOP context, is &lt;em&gt;constructor&lt;/em&gt;, even if the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method is not the only part of this mechanism in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;self.number&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;self.status&lt;/code&gt; variables are called &lt;em&gt;attributes&lt;/em&gt; of the object. In Python, methods and attributes are both &lt;em&gt;members&lt;/em&gt; of the object and are accessible with the dotted syntax; the difference between attributes and methods is that the latter can be called (in Python lingo you say that a method is a &lt;em&gt;callable&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method shall create and initialize the attributes since they are not declared elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class can be used to create a concrete object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Door&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;code&gt;door1&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt; class; &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; returns the class as &lt;code&gt;__main__.Door&lt;/code&gt; since the class was defined directly in the interactive shell, that is in the current main module. To call a method of an object, that is to run one of its internal functions, you just access it as an attribute with the dotted syntax and call it like a standard function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this case, the &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;door1&lt;/code&gt; instance has been called. No arguments have been passed to the &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; method, but if you review the class declaration, you see that it was declared to accept an argument (&lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;). When you call a method of an instance, Python automatically passes the instance itself to the method as the first argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create as many instances as needed and they are completely unrelated each other. That is the changes you make on one instance do not reflect on another instance of the same class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Recap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects are described by a &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;, which can generate one or more &lt;em&gt;instances&lt;/em&gt;, unrelated each other. A class contains &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt;, which are functions, and they accept at least one argument called &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, which is the actual instance on which the method has been called. A special method, &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; deals with the initialization of the object, setting the initial value of the &lt;em&gt;attributes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Classes Strike Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python implementation of classes has some peculiarities. The bare truth is that in Python the class of an object is an object itself. You can check this by issuing &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; on the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Door&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shows that the &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt; class is an object, an instance of the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept is not so difficult to grasp as it can seem at first sight: in the real world we deal with concepts using them like &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;: for example we can talk about the concept of "door", telling people how a door looks like and how it works. So in our everyday experience the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of an object is an object itself. In Python this can be expressed by saying that &lt;em&gt;everything is an object&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the class is an instance it is a concrete object and is stored somewhere in memory. Let us leverage the &lt;em&gt;inspection&lt;/em&gt; capabilities of Python and its &lt;code&gt;id()&lt;/code&gt; function to check the status of our objects. The &lt;code&gt;id()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function returns the memory position of an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, let's check that the two objects are stored at different addresses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x7fa4c818bad0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x7fa4c818b890&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This confirms that the two instances are separate and unrelated.
&lt;strong&gt;Please note that your values are very likely to be different from the ones I got.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if we use &lt;code&gt;id()&lt;/code&gt; on the class of the two instances we discover that the class is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x766800&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x766800&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well this is very important. In Python, a class is not just the schema used to build an object. Rather, the class is a shared living object, which code is accessed at run time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we already tested, however, attributes are not stored in the class but in every instance, due to the fact that &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; works on &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; when creating them. Classes, however, can be given attributes like any other object; with a terrific effort of imagination, let's call them &lt;em&gt;class attributes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can expect, class attributes are shared among the class instances just like their container&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;colour&lt;/code&gt; attribute here is not created using &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, and any change of its value reflects on all instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0xb74c5420L&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0xb74c5420L&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0xb74c5420L&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Raiders of the Lost Attribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Python object is automatically given a &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which contains its list of attributes. Let's investigate what this dictionary contains for our example objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;dict_proxy({&amp;#39;__module__&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__weakref__&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;attribute &amp;#39;__weakref__&amp;#39; of &amp;#39;Door&amp;#39; objects&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__dict__&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;attribute &amp;#39;__dict__&amp;#39; of &amp;#39;Door&amp;#39; objects&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;close&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function close at 0xb6a8a56c&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;open&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function open at 0xb6a8a534&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__doc__&amp;#39;: None,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__init__&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function __init__ at 0xb6a8a48c&amp;gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;{&amp;#39;status&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;number&amp;#39;: 1}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the difference between a dictionary and a &lt;code&gt;dict_proxy&lt;/code&gt; object, you can see that the &lt;code&gt;colour&lt;/code&gt; attribute is listed among the &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt; class attributes, while &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; are listed for the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How comes that we can call &lt;code&gt;door1.colour&lt;/code&gt;, if that attribute is not listed for that instance? This is a job performed by the magic &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; method; in Python the dotted syntax automatically invokes this method so when we write &lt;code&gt;door1.colour&lt;/code&gt;, Python executes &lt;code&gt;door1.__getattribute__('colour')&lt;/code&gt;. That method performs the  &lt;em&gt;attribute  lookup&lt;/em&gt; action, i.e. finds the value of the attribute by looking in different places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard implementation of &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; searches first the internal dictionary (&lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt;) of an object, then the type of the object itself; in this case &lt;code&gt;door1.__getattribute__('colour')&lt;/code&gt; executes first &lt;code&gt;door1.__dict__['colour']&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;door1.__class__.__dict__['colour']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;KeyError: &amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if we check the objects equality through the &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator we can confirm that both &lt;code&gt;door1.colour&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Door.colour&lt;/code&gt; are exactly the same object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When we try to assign a value to a class attribute directly on an instance, we just put in the &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; of the instance a value with that name, and this value masks the class attribute since it is found first by &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt;. As you can see from the examples of the previous section, this is different from changing the value of the attribute on the class itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Revenge of the Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's play the same game with methods. First of all you can see that, just like class attributes, methods are listed only in the class &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt;. Chances are that they behave the same as attributes when we get them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Whoops. Let us further investigate the matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;function open at 0xb73ee10c&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;unbound method Door.open&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method Door.open of &amp;lt;__main__.Door object at 0xb73f956c&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, the class method is listed in the members dictionary as &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;. So far, so good. The same method, taken directly from the class is returned as &lt;em&gt;unbound method&lt;/em&gt;, while taking it from the instance it changes to &lt;em&gt;bound method&lt;/em&gt;. Well, a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; is a procedure you named and defined with the &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; statement. When you refer to a function as part of a class you get an unbound method. The name &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; simply means "a function inside a class", according to the usual OOP definitions, while &lt;em&gt;unbound&lt;/em&gt; signals that the method is not bound to any instance. As you can see, as soon as you access the method from an instance, the method becomes &lt;em&gt;bound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Python bother with methods being bound or unbound? And how does Python transform an unbound method into a bound one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you try to call an unbound method you get an error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Traceback  (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;TypeError: unbound method open() must be called with&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    Door instance as first argument (got nothing instead)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;so by default Python considers methods as functions that shall operate on instances, and calling them from the class leaves the interpreter puzzled. Let us try to pass the instance as suggested by the exception message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Python does not complain here, and the method works as expected. So &lt;code&gt;Door.open(door1)&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;door1.open()&lt;/code&gt;. Again, under the hood, &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; is working to make everything work and when we call &lt;code&gt;door1.open()&lt;/code&gt;, Python actually calls &lt;code&gt;door1.__class__.open(door1)&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;door1.__class__.open&lt;/code&gt; is an unbound method, so there is something more that converts it into a bound method that Python can safely call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you access a member of an object, Python calls &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; to satisfy the request. This magic method, however, conforms to a procedure known as &lt;em&gt;descriptor protocol&lt;/em&gt;. For the read access &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; checks if the object has a &lt;code&gt;__get__()&lt;/code&gt; method and calls this latter. So for function the conversion from an unbound into a bound method is made by such a mechanism. Let us review it by means of an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;function open at 0xb73ee10c&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This syntax retrieves the function defined in the class; the function knows nothing about objects, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an object (remember "everything is an object"). So we can look inside it with the &lt;code&gt;dir()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;#39;__call__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__class__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__closure__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__code__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__defaults__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt; &amp;#39;__delattr__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__dict__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__doc__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__format__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__get__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt; &amp;#39;__getattribute__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__globals__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__hash__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__init__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt; &amp;#39;__module__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__name__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__new__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__reduce__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__reduce_ex__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt; &amp;#39;__repr__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__setattr__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__sizeof__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__str__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__subclasshook__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt; &amp;#39;func_closure&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;func_code&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;func_defaults&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;func_dict&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;func_doc&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt; &amp;#39;func_globals&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;func_name&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;method-wrapper &amp;#39;__get__&amp;#39; of function object at 0xb73ee10c&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, a &lt;code&gt;__get__&lt;/code&gt; method is listed among the members of the function, and Python recognizes it as a &lt;em&gt;method-wrapper&lt;/em&gt;. This method shall connect the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function to the &lt;code&gt;door1&lt;/code&gt; instance, so we can call it passing the instance alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method ?.open of &amp;lt;__main__.Door object at 0xb73f956c&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ok, something is missing. Indeed &lt;code&gt;__get__()&lt;/code&gt; in this case also accepts the &lt;em&gt;owner&lt;/em&gt; class, i.e. the class we are trying to get the attribute from. So the correct form is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method Door.open of &amp;lt;__main__.Door object at 0xb73f956c&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;When methods met classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; on an unbound method, we get an interesting result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;function open at 0xb6aa548c&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;instancemethod&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The method is an &lt;em&gt;instance method&lt;/em&gt;; as we discovered, it shall be bound to an instance to work, so the name is a good choice. Does this imply that we can also define a &lt;em&gt;class method&lt;/em&gt;? Indeed we can, through the &lt;code&gt;classmethod&lt;/code&gt; decorator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Knock!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Such a definition makes the method callable on both the instance and the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Knock!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Knock!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method type.knock of &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Door&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method type.knock of &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Door&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this is possible since, as you can see, both the class method and the instance method are bound. The class method is bound to the class itself, while the instance method is bound to the instance of the class. What about the type of the method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;knock&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;classmethod object at 0xb6a8db6c&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;instancemethod&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Puzzled? Don't be confused! When you look in the &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; you are not going through the &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__get__()&lt;/code&gt; machinery, so you get the plain unprocessed attribute. With standard methods you find &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; objects in the members dictionary, while for class methods you find &lt;code&gt;classmethod&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, when you check the type of &lt;code&gt;door1.__class__.knock&lt;/code&gt; you implicitly invoke &lt;code&gt;__get__()&lt;/code&gt;, which binds the method to the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;knock&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;instancemethod&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;knock&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;type &amp;#39;classmethod&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After all, it is no surprise that a class method is bound since a class is an instance of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intermezzo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize now that I introduced this post as "a set of thoughts for Python beginners". Sorry. If you are reading this, however, chances are that you are still alive. Calm down. Breathe. Relaxed? Ready to go? Let's dive into delegation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Delegation Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If classes are objects what is the difference between types and instances? When I talk about "my cat" I am referring to a concrete instance of the "cat" concept, which is a &lt;em&gt;subtype&lt;/em&gt; of "animal". So, despite being both objects, while types can be &lt;em&gt;specialized&lt;/em&gt;, instances cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually an object B is said to be a specialization of an object A when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B has all the features of A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B can provide new features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B can perform some or all the tasks performed by A in a different way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those targets are very general and valid for any system and the key to achieve them with the maximum reuse of already existing components is &lt;em&gt;delegation&lt;/em&gt;. Delegation means that an object shall perform only what it knows best, and leave the rest to other objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation can be implemented with two different mechanisms: &lt;em&gt;composition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt;. Sadly, very often inheritance is listed among the pillars of OOP techniques, forgetting that it is an implementation of the more generic and fundamental mechanism of delegation; perhaps a better nomenclature for the two techniques could be &lt;em&gt;explicit delegation&lt;/em&gt; (composition) and &lt;em&gt;implicit delegation&lt;/em&gt; (inheritance). Please note that, again, when talking about composition and inheritance we are talking about focusing on a behavioural or structural delegation. Another way to think about the difference between composition and inheritance is to consider if the object &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; who can satisfy your request or if the object &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the one that satisfy the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, please, please do not forget composition: in many cases, composition can lead you to a simpler system, with benefits on maintainability and changeability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually composition is said to be a very generic technique that needs no special syntax, while inheritance and its rules are strongly dependent on the language of choice. Actually, the strong dynamic nature of Python softens the boundary line between the two techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inheritance Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python a class can be declared as an &lt;em&gt;extension&lt;/em&gt; of one or more different classes, through the &lt;em&gt;class inheritance&lt;/em&gt; mechanism. The child class (the one that inherits) internally has the same structure of the parent class (the one that is inherited), and for the case of multiple inheritance the language has very specific rules to manage possible conflicts or redefinitions among the parent classes. A very simple example of inheritance is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where we declare a new class &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; that, at the moment, is a perfect copy of the &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt; class. Let us investigate what happens when we access attributes and methods. First we instance the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first check we can do is that class attributes are still global and shared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shows us that Python tries to resolve instance members not only looking into the class the instance comes from, but also investigating the parent classes. In this case &lt;code&gt;sdoor.colour&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor.colour&lt;/code&gt;, that in turn becomes &lt;code&gt;Door.colour&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we investigate the content of &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; we can catch a glimpse of the inheritance mechanism in action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;{&amp;#39;status&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;number&amp;#39;: 1}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;dict_proxy({&amp;#39;__module__&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;__doc__&amp;#39;: None})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;dict_proxy({&amp;#39;knock&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;classmethod object at 0xb6a8db6c&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__module__&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__weakref__&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;attribute &amp;#39;__weakref__&amp;#39; of &amp;#39;Door&amp;#39; objects&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__dict__&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;attribute &amp;#39;__dict__&amp;#39; of &amp;#39;Door&amp;#39; objects&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;close&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function close at 0xb6aa5454&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;open&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function open at 0xb6aa53e4&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__doc__&amp;#39;: None,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__init__&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function __init__ at 0xb6aa51ec&amp;gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the content of &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; is very narrow compared to that of &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt;. The inheritance mechanism takes care of the missing elements by climbing up the classes tree. Where does Python get the parent classes? A class always contains a &lt;code&gt;__bases__&lt;/code&gt; tuple that lists them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bases__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;(&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.Door&amp;#39;&amp;gt;,)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So an example of what Python does to resolve a class method call through the inheritance tree is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bases__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;knock&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method type.knock of &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.SecurityDoor&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sdoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;knock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;bound method type.knock of &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;__main__.SecurityDoor&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please note that this is just an example that does not consider multiple inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us try now to override some methods and attributes. In Python you can &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; (redefine) a parent class member simply by redefining it in the child class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gray&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can forecast, the overridden members now are present in the &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__dict__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;dict_proxy({&amp;#39;locked&amp;#39;: True,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__module__&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;open&amp;#39;: &amp;lt;function open at 0xb73d8844&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;colour&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;gray&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;    &amp;#39;__doc__&amp;#39;: None})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So when you override a member, the one you put in the child class is used instead of the one in the parent class simply because the former is found before the latter while climbing the class hierarchy. This also shows you that Python does not implicitly call the parent implementation when you override a method. So, overriding is a way to block implicit delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to call the parent implementation we have to do it explicitly. In the former example we could write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gray&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can easily test that this implementation is working correctly. This form of explicit parent delegation is heavily discouraged, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason is because of the very high coupling that results from explicitly naming the parent class again when calling the method; if you decide to use a new parent class you have to manually propagate the change to every method that calls it. Moreover, since in Python the class hierarchy can be dynamically changed (i.e. at runtime), this form of explicit delegation could be not only annoying but wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that in general you need to deal with multiple inheritance, where you do not know a priori which parent class implements the original form of the method you are overriding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues, Python supplies the &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function, that climbs the class hierarchy and returns the correct class that shall be called. The syntax for calling &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gray&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see you have to explicitly pass the class you are in and the current instance. This is a (indeed very light) form of repetition that has been fixed in Python 3.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter the Composition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composition means that an object knows another object, and explicitly delegates some tasks to it. While inheritance is implicit, composition is explicit: in Python, however, things are far more interesting than this =).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all let us implement classic composition, which simply makes an object part of the other as an attribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gray&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of composition is to relax the coupling between objects. This little example shows that now &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and no more a &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt;, which means that the internal structure of &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt; is not copied. For this very simple example both &lt;code&gt;Door&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; are not big classes, but in a real system objects can very complex; this means that their allocation consumes a lot of memory and if a system contains thousands or millions of objects that could be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, however, our solution is far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composed &lt;code&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/code&gt; has to redefine the &lt;code&gt;colour&lt;/code&gt; attribute since the concept of delegation applies only to methods and not to attributes, doesn't it? Well, no. Python provides a very high degree of indirection for objects manipulation and attribute access is one of the most useful. As you already discovered, accessing attributes is ruled by a special method called &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; that is called whenever an attribute of the object is accessed. Overriding &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt;, however, is overkill; it is a very complex method, and, being called on every attribute access, any change makes the whole thing slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method we have to leverage to delegate attribute access is &lt;code&gt;__getattr__()&lt;/code&gt;, which is a special method that is called whenever the requested attribute is not found in the object. So basically it is the right place to dispatch all attribute and method access our object cannot handle. In the previous example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SecurityDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getattr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;__getattr__()&lt;/code&gt; blends the separation line between inheritance and composition since after all the former is a form of automatic delegation of every member access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ComposedDoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getattr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As this last example shows, delegating every member access through &lt;code&gt;__getattr__()&lt;/code&gt; is very simple. Pay attention to &lt;code&gt;getattr()&lt;/code&gt; which is different from &lt;code&gt;__getattr__()&lt;/code&gt;. The former is a built-in that is equivalent to the dotted syntax, i.e. &lt;code&gt;getattr(obj, 'someattr')&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;obj.someattr&lt;/code&gt;, but you have to use it since the name of the attribute is contained in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composition provides a superior way to manage delegation since it can selectively delegate the access, even mask some attributes or methods, while inheritance cannot. In Python you also avoid the memory problems that might arise when you put many objects inside another; Python handles everything through its reference, i.e. through a pointer to the memory position of the thing, so the size of an attribute is constant and very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much more that can be said about the Python implementation of objects, classes, and friends. Just to name a couple of things, the object creation mechanism and the relationship between &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; have not been explained. Hopefully, there will be space in a later post. In the second post, however, I'll start talking about polymorphism, Abstract Base Classes, and metaclasses. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movie Trivia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering why section titles are so weird, chances are that you missed some good movies to watch while you are not coding =). The movies are: &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;What About Bob?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wargames&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Nerds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Cannonball Run&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse Now&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enter the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014-03-08: "When methods met classes" section had a typo: the sentence "The class method is bound to the class itself, while the instance method is bound to the class of the instance." is "while the instance method is bound to instance of the class.". Thanks &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116309787480950087834/posts"&gt;Mohcin Shah&lt;/a&gt; for spotting it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014-03-10: Fixed link to Alex Martelli's presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014-04-07: A typo when discussing &lt;code&gt;door1.colour&lt;/code&gt; has been fixed. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/pujuma"&gt;pujuma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
