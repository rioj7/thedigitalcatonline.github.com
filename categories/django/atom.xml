&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently worked with young web developers who were exposed for the first time to proper production infrastructure, I received many questions about the various components that one can find in the architecture of a "Web service". These questions clearly expressed the confusion (and sometimes the frustration) of developers who understand how to create endpoints in a high-level language such as Node.js or Python, but were never introduced to the complexity of what happens between the user's browser and their framework of choice. Most of the times they don't know why the framework itself is there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is clear if we just list (in random order), some of the words we use when we discuss (Python) Web development: HTTP, cookies, web server, Websockets, FTP, multi-threaded, reverse proxy, Django, nginx, static files, POST, certificates, framework, Flask, SSL, GET, WSGI, session management, TLS, load balancing, Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to review all the words mentioned above (and a couple more) trying to build a production-ready web service from the ground up. I hope this might help young developers to get the whole picture and to make sense of these "obscure" names that senior developers like me tend to drop in everyday conversations (sometimes arguably out of turn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the focus of the post is the global architecture and the reasons behind the presence of specific components, the example service I will use will be a basic HTML web page. The reference language will be Python but the overall discussion applies to any language or framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach will be that of first stating the rationale and then implementing a possible solution. After this, I will point out missing pieces or unresolved issues and move on with the next layer. At the end of the process, the reader should have a clear picture of why each component has been added to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-perfect-architecture"&gt;The perfect architecture&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-perfect-architecture" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important underlying concept of system architectures is that there is no &lt;em&gt;perfect solution&lt;/em&gt; devised by some wiser genius, that we just need to apply. Unfortunately, often people mistake design patterns for such a "magic solution". The "Design Patterns" original book, however, states that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your design should be specific to the problem at hand but also general enough to address future problems and requirements. You also want to avoid redesign, or at least minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architectures. [...] Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the book are discussing Object-oriented Programming, but these sentences can be applied to any architecture. As you can see, we have a "problem at hand" and "design alternatives", which means that the most important thing to understand is the requirements, both the present and future ones. Only with clear requirements in mind, one can effectively design a solution, possibly tapping into the great number of patterns that other designers already devised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very last remark. A web stack is a complex beast, made of several components and software packages developed by different programmers with different goals in mind. It is perfectly understandable, then, that such components have some degree of superposition. While the division line between theoretical layers is usually very clear, in practice the separation is often blurry. Expect this a lot, and you will never be lost in a web stack anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="some-definitions"&gt;Some definitions&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#some-definitions" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's briefly review some of the most important concepts involved in a Web stack, the protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tcpip"&gt;TCP/IP&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#tcpip" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP is a network protocol, that is, a &lt;em&gt;set of established rules&lt;/em&gt; two computers have to follow to get connected over a physical network to exchange messages. TCP/IP is composed of two different protocols covering two different layers of the OSI stack, namely the Transport (TCP) and the Network (IP) ones. TCP/IP can be implemented on top of any physical interface (Data Link and Physical OSI layers), such as Ethernet and Wireless. Actors in a TCP/IP network are identified by a &lt;em&gt;socket&lt;/em&gt;, which is a tuple made of an IP address and a port number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as we are concerned when developing a Web service, however, we need to be aware that TCP/IP is a &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; protocol, which in telecommunications means that the protocol itself takes care or retransmissions when packets get lost. In other words, while the speed of the communication is not granted, we can be sure that once a message is sent it will reach its destination without errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="http"&gt;HTTP&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#http" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP can guarantee that the raw bytes one computer sends will reach their destination, but this leaves completely untouched the problem of how to send meaningful information. In particular, in 1989 the problem Tim Barners-Lee wanted to solve was how to uniquely name hypertext resources in a network and how to access them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is the protocol that was devised to solve such a problem and has since greatly evolved. With the help of other protocols such as WebSocket, HTTP invaded areas of communication for which it was originally considered unsuitable such as real-time communication or gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, HTTP is a protocol that states the format of a text request and the possible text responses. The initial version 0.9 published in 1991 defined the concept of URL and allowed only the GET operation that requested a specific resource. HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 added crucial features such as headers, more methods, and important performance optimisations. At the time of writing the adoption of HTTP/2 is around 45% of the websites in the world, and HTTP/3 is still a draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important feature of HTTP we need to keep in mind as developers is that it is a &lt;em&gt;stateless&lt;/em&gt; protocol. This means that the protocol doesn't require the server to keep track of the state of the communication between requests, basically leaving session management to the developer of the service itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session management is crucial nowadays because you usually want to have an authentication layer in front of a service, where a user provides credentials and accesses some private data. It is, however, useful in other contexts such as visual preferences or choices made by the user and re-used in later accesses to the same website. Typical solutions to the session management problem of HTTP involve the use of cookies or session tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="https"&gt;HTTPS&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#https" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security has become a very important word in recent years, and with a reason. The amount of sensitive data we exchange on the Internet or store on digital devices is increasing exponentially, but unfortunately so is the number of malicious attackers and the level of damage they can cause with their actions. The HTTP protocol is inherently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is inherently insecure, being a plain text communication between two servers that usually happens on a completely untrustable network such as the Internet. While security wasn't an issue when the protocol was initially conceived, it is nowadays a problem of paramount importance, as we exchange private information, often vital for people's security or for businesses. We need to be sure we are sending information to the correct server and that the data we send cannot be intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS solves both the problem of tampering and eavesdropping, encrypting HTTP with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, that also enforces the usage of digital certificates, issued by a trusted authority. At the time of writing, approximately 80% of websites loaded by Firefox use HTTPS by default. When a server receives an HTTPS connection and transforms it into an HTTP one it is usually said that it &lt;em&gt;terminates TLS&lt;/em&gt; (or SSL, the old name of TLS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="websocket"&gt;WebSocket&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#websocket" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One great disadvantage of HTTP is that communication is always initiated by the client and that the server can send data only when this is explicitly requested. Polling can be implemented to provide an initial solution, but it cannot guarantee the performances of proper full-duplex communication, where a channel is kept open between server and client and both can send data without being requested. Such a channel is provided by the WebSocket protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebSocket is a killer technology for applications like online gaming, real-time feeds like financial tickers or sports news, or multimedia communication like conferencing or remote education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that WebSocket is not HTTP, and can exist without it. It is also true that this new protocol was designed to be used on top of an existing HTTP connection, so a WebSocket communication is often found in parts of a Web page, which was originally retrieved using HTTP in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="implementing-a-service-over-http"&gt;Implementing a service over HTTP&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-a-service-over-http" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's finally start discussing bits and bytes. The starting point for our journey is a service over HTTP, which means there is an HTTP request-response exchange. As an example, let us consider a GET request, the simplest of the HTTP methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;User-Agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;curl/7.65.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;*/*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the client is sending a pure text message to the server, with the format specified by the HTTP protocol. The first line contains the method name (&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;), the URL (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;) and the protocol we are using, including its version (&lt;code&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/code&gt;). The remaining lines are called &lt;em&gt;headers&lt;/em&gt; and contain metadata that can help the server to manage the request. The complete value of the &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header is in this case &lt;code&gt;localhost:80&lt;/code&gt;, but as the standard port for HTTP services is 80, we don't need to specify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the server &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;serving&lt;/em&gt; HTTP (i.e. running some software that understands HTTP) on port 80 the response we might get is something similar to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:41:33 GMT
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: 26889
Last-Modified: Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:41:27 GMT

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
...
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As happened for the request, the response is a text message, formatted according to the standard. The first line mentions the protocol and the status of the request (&lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; in this case, that means success), while the following lines contain metadata in various headers. Finally, after an empty line, the message contains the resource the client asked for, the source code of the base URL of the website in this case. Since this HTML page probably contains references to other resources like CSS, JS, images, and so on, the browser will send several other requests to gather all the data it needs to properly show the page to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first problem we have is that of implementing a server that understands this protocol and sends a proper response when it receives an HTTP request. We should try to load the requested resource and return either a success (HTTP 200) if we can find it, or a failure (HTTP 404) if we can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1-sockets-and-parsers"&gt;1 Sockets and parsers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#1-sockets-and-parsers" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="11-rationale"&gt;1.1 Rationale&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#11-rationale" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP is a network protocol that works with &lt;em&gt;sockets&lt;/em&gt;. A socket is a tuple of an IP address (unique in the network) and a port (unique for a specific IP address) that the computer uses to communicate with others. A socket is a file-like object in an operating system, that can be thus &lt;em&gt;opened&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt;, and that we can &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; from or &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; to. Socket programming is a pretty low-level approach to the network, but you need to be aware that every software in your computer that provides network access has ultimately to deal with sockets (most probably through some library, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are building things from the ground up, let's implement a small Python program that opens a socket connection, receives an HTTP request, and sends an HTTP response. As port 80 is a "low port" (a number smaller than 1024), we usually don't have permissions to open sockets there, so I will use port 8080. This is not a problem for now, as HTTP can be served on any port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="12-implementation"&gt;1.2 Implementation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#12-implementation" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the file &lt;code&gt;server.py&lt;/code&gt; and type this code. Yes, &lt;strong&gt;type it&lt;/strong&gt;, don't just copy and paste, you will not learn anything otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create a socket instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# AF_INET: use IP protocol version 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# SOCK_STREAM: full-duplex byte stream&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AF_INET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SOCK_STREAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Allow reuse of addresses&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setsockopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SOL_SOCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SO_REUSEADDR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Bind the socket to any address, port 8080, and listen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Serve forever&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Accept the connection&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Receive data from this socket using a buffer of 1024 bytes&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Print out the data&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Close the connection&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This little program accepts a connection on port 8080 and prints the received data on the terminal. You can test it executing it and then running &lt;code&gt;curl localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; in another terminal. You should see something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python3 server.py 
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/7.65.3
Accept: */*
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The server keeps running the code in the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, so if you want to terminate it you have to do it with Ctrl+C. So far so good, but this is not an HTTP server yet, as it sends no response; you should actually receive an error message from curl that says &lt;code&gt;curl: (52) Empty reply from server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending back a standard response is very simple, we just need to call &lt;code&gt;conn.sendall&lt;/code&gt; passing the raw bytes. A minimal HTTP response contains the protocol and the status, an empty line, and the actual content, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our server becomes then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create a socket instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# AF_INET: use IP protocol version 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# SOCK_STREAM: full-duplex byte stream&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AF_INET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SOCK_STREAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Allow reuse of addresses&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setsockopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SOL_SOCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SO_REUSEADDR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Bind the socket to any address, port 8080, and listen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Serve forever&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Accept the connection&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Receive data from this socket using a buffer of 1024 bytes&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Print out the data&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sendall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hi there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Close the connection&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point, we are not really responding to the user's request, however. Try different curl command lines like &lt;code&gt;curl localhost:8080/index.html&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;curl localhost:8080/main.css&lt;/code&gt; and you will always receive the same response. We should try to find the resource the user is asking for and send that back in the response content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of the HTTP server properly extracts the resource and tries to load it from the current directory, returning either a success of a failure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create a socket instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# AF_INET: use IP protocol version 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# SOCK_STREAM: full-duplex byte stream&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AF_INET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SOCK_STREAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Allow reuse of addresses&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setsockopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SOL_SOCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SO_REUSEADDR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Bind the socket to any address, port 8080, and listen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;HEAD_200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;HEAD_404&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Serve forever&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Accept the connection&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Receive data from this socket using a buffer of 1024 bytes&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Print out the data&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET /(.*) HTTP&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;FileNotFoundError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HEAD_404&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Resource /&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; cannot be found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Resource &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; cannot be loaded&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;--------------------&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sendall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Close the connection&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see this implementation is extremely simple. If you create a simple local file named &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; with this content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is my page&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;main.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Some random content&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and run &lt;code&gt;curl localhost:8080/index.html&lt;/code&gt; you will see the content of the file. At this point, you can even use your browser to open &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080/index.html&lt;/code&gt; and you will see the title of the page and the content. A Web browser is a software capable of sending HTTP requests and of interpreting the content of the responses if this is HTML (and many other file types like images or videos), so it can &lt;em&gt;render&lt;/em&gt; the content of the message. The browser is also responsible of retrieving the missing resources needed for the rendering, so when you provide links to style sheets or JS scripts with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags in the HTML code of a page, you are instructing the browser to send an HTTP GET request for those files as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of &lt;code&gt;server.py&lt;/code&gt; when I access &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080/index.html&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;/index.html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;localhost:8080&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;User-Agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Accept-Language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;en-GB,en;q=0.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Accept-Encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;gzip, deflate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;keep-alive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Upgrade-Insecure-Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Pragma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;no-cache&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l"&gt;no-cache&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the browser sends rich HTTP requests, with a lot of headers, automatically requesting the CSS file mentioned in the HTML code and automatically trying to retrieve a favicon image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives a certain dose of satisfaction to build something from scratch and discover that it works smoothly with full-fledged software like the browser you use every day. I also think it is very interesting to discover that technologies like HTTP, that basically run the world nowadays, are at their core very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are many features of HTTP that we didn't cover with our simple socket programming. For starters, HTTP/1.0 introduced other methods after GET, such as POST that is of paramount importance for today's websites, where users keep sending information to servers through forms. To implement all 9 HTTP methods we need to properly parse the incoming request and add relevant functions to our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, however, you might notice that we are dealing a lot with low-level details of the protocol, which is usually not the core of our business. When we build a service over HTTP we believe that we have the knowledge to properly implement some code that can simplify a certain process, be it searching for other websites, shopping for books or sharing pictures with friends. We don't want to spend our time understanding the subtleties of the TCP/IP sockets and writing parsers for request-response protocols. It is nice to see how these technologies work, but on a daily basis, we need to focus on something at a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation of our small HTTP server is possibly worsened by the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol. The protocol doesn't provide any way to connect two successive requests, thus keeping track of the &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; of the communication, which is the cornerstone of modern Internet. Every time we authenticate on a website and we want to visit other pages we need the server to remember who we are, and this implies keeping track of the state of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short: to work as a proper HTTP server, our code should at this point implement all HTTP methods and cookies management. We also need to support other protocols like Websockets. These are all but trivial tasks, so we definitely need to add some component to the whole system that lets us focus on the business logic and not on the low-level details of application protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I discussed many times (see &lt;a href="https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2018/12/20/cabook/"&gt;the book on clean architectures&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2016/11/14/clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example/"&gt;the relative post&lt;/a&gt;) the role of the Web framework is that of &lt;em&gt;converting HTTP requests into function calls&lt;/em&gt;, and function return values into HTTP responses. The framework's true nature is that of a layer that connects a working business logic to the Web, through HTTP and related protocols. The framework takes care of session management for us and maps URLs to functions, allowing us to focus on the application logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of an HTTP service, this is what the framework is supposed to do. Everything the framework provides out of this scope, like layers to access DBs, template engines, and interfaces to other systems, is an addition that you, as a programmer, may find useful, but is not in principle part of the reason why we added the framework to the system. We add the framework because it acts as a layer between our business logic and HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Miguel Gringberg and his &lt;a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world"&gt;amazing Flask mega-tutorial&lt;/a&gt; I can set up Flask in seconds. I will not run through the tutorial here, as you can follow it on Miguel's website. I will only use the content of the first article (out of 23!) to create an extremely simple "Hello, world" application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the following example you will need a virtual environment and you will have to &lt;code&gt;pip install flask&lt;/code&gt;. Follow Miguel's tutorial if you need more details on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;app/__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the &lt;code&gt;app/routes.py&lt;/code&gt; file is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/index&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can already see here the power of a framework in action. We defined an &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; function and connected it with two different URLs (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/index&lt;/code&gt;) in 3 lines of Python. This leaves us time and energy to properly work on the business logic, that in this case is a revolutionary "Hello, world!". Nobody ever did this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;service.py&lt;/code&gt; file is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Flask comes with a so-called development web server (do these words ring any bell now?) that we can run on a terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;FLASK_APP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;service.py flask run
 * Serving Flask app &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;service.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Press CTRL+C to quit&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can now visit the given URL with your browser and see that everything works properly. Remember that 127.0.0.1 is the special IP address that refers to "this computer"; the name &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; is usually created by the operating system as an alias for that, so the two are interchangeable. As you can see the standard port for Flask's development server is 5000, so you have to mention it explicitly, otherwise your browser would try to access port 80 (the default HTTP one). When you connect with the browser you will see some log messages about the HTTP requests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;127&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.1 - - &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020 &lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;:54:27&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; -
&lt;span class="m"&gt;127&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.1 - - &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020 &lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;:54:28&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt; -
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can recognise both now, as those are the same request we got with our little server in the previous part of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we solved all our problems, and many programmers just stop here. They learn how to use the framework (which is a big achievement!), but as we will shortly discover, this is not enough for a production system. Let's have a closer look at the output of the Flask server. It clearly says, among other things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main issue we have when we deal with any production system is represented by performances. Think about what we do with JavaScript when we minimise the code: we consciously obfuscate the code in order to make the file smaller, but this is done for the sole purpose of making the file faster to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For HTTP servers the story is not very different. The Web framework usually provides a development Web server, as Flask does, which properly implements HTTP, but does it in a very inefficient way. For starters, this is a &lt;em&gt;blocking&lt;/em&gt; framework, which means that if our request takes seconds to be served (for example because the endpoint retrieves data from a very slow database), any other request will have to wait to be served in a queue. That ultimately means that the user will see a spinner in the browser's tab and just shake their head thinking that we can't build a modern website. Other performances concerns might be connected with memory management or disk caches, but in general, we are safe to say that this web server cannot handle any production load (i.e. multiple users accessing the web site at the same time and expecting good quality of service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hardly surprising. After all, we didn't want to deal with TCP/IP connections to focus on our business, so we delegated this to other coders who maintain the framework. The framework's authors, in turn, want to focus on things like middleware, routes, proper handling of HTTP methods, and so on. They don't want to spend time trying to optimise the performances of the "multi-user" experience. This is especially true in the Python world (and somehow less true for Node.js, for example): Python is not heavily concurrency-oriented, and both the style of programming and the performances are not favouring fast, non-blocking applications. This is changing lately, with async and improvements in the interpreter, but I leave this for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that we have a full-fledged HTTP service, we need to make it so fast that users won't even notice this is not running locally on their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3-concurrency-and-facades"&gt;3 Concurrency and façades&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#3-concurrency-and-facades" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="31-rationale"&gt;3.1 Rationale&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#31-rationale" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, whenever you have performance issues, just go for concurrency. Now you have many problems!
(see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidlohr/status/288786300067270656?lang=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, concurrency solves many problems and it's the source of just as much, so we need to find a way to use it in the safest and less complicated way. We basically might want to add a layer that runs the framework in some concurrent way, without requiring us to change anything in the framework itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whenever you have to homogenise different things just create a layer of indirection. This solves any problem but one. (see &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to create a layer that runs our service in a concurrent way, but we also want to keep it detached from the specific implementation of the service, that is independent of the framework or library that we are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="32-implementation"&gt;3.2 Implementation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#32-implementation" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the solution is that of giving a &lt;em&gt;specification&lt;/em&gt; of the API that web frameworks have to expose, in order to be usable by independent third-party components. In the Python world, this set of rules has been named WSGI, the Web Server Gateway Interface, but such interfaces exist for other languages such as Java or Ruby. The "gateway" mentioned here is the part of the system outside the framework, which in this discussion is the part that deals with production performances. Through WSGI we are defining a way for frameworks to expose a common interface, leaving people interested in concurrency free to implement something independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the framework is compatible with the gateway interface, we can add software that deals with concurrency and uses the framework through the compatibility layer. Such a component is a production-ready HTTP server, and two common choices in the Python world are Gunicorn and uWSGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production-ready HTTP server means that the software understands HTTP as the development server already did, but at the same time pushes performances in order to sustain a bigger workload, and as we said before this is done through concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask is compatible with WSGI, so we can make it work with Gunicorn. To install it in our virtual environment run &lt;code&gt;pip install gunicorn&lt;/code&gt; and set it up creating a file names &lt;code&gt;wsgi.py&lt;/code&gt; with the following content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To run Gunicorn specify the number of concurrent instances and the external port&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ gunicorn --workers &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; --bind &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.0:8000 wsgi
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-12 &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;:39:07 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13393&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Starting gunicorn &lt;span class="m"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;.0.4
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-12 &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;:39:07 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13393&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13393&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-12 &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;:39:07 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13393&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Using worker: sync
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-12 &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;:39:07 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13396&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Booting worker with pid: &lt;span class="m"&gt;13396&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-12 &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;:39:07 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13397&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Booting worker with pid: &lt;span class="m"&gt;13397&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-12 &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;:39:07 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;13398&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Booting worker with pid: &lt;span class="m"&gt;13398&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Gunicorn has the concept of &lt;em&gt;workers&lt;/em&gt; which are a generic way to express concurrency. Specifically, Gunicorn implements a pre-fork worker model, which means that it (pre)creates a different Unix process for each worker. You can check this running &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ps ax &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep gunicorn
&lt;span class="m"&gt;14919&lt;/span&gt; pts/1    S+     &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:00 ~/venv3/bin/python3 ~/venv3/bin/gunicorn --workers &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; --bind &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.0:8000 wsgi
&lt;span class="m"&gt;14922&lt;/span&gt; pts/1    S+     &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:00 ~/venv3/bin/python3 ~/venv3/bin/gunicorn --workers &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; --bind &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.0:8000 wsgi
&lt;span class="m"&gt;14923&lt;/span&gt; pts/1    S+     &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:00 ~/venv3/bin/python3 ~/venv3/bin/gunicorn --workers &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; --bind &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.0:8000 wsgi
&lt;span class="m"&gt;14924&lt;/span&gt; pts/1    S+     &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:00 ~/venv3/bin/python3 ~/venv3/bin/gunicorn --workers &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; --bind &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.0.0.0:8000 wsgi
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using processes is just one of the two ways to implement concurrency in a Unix system, the other being using threads. The benefits and demerits of each solution are outside the scope of this post, however. For the time being just remember that you are dealing with multiple workers that process incoming requests asynchronously, thus implementing a non-blocking server, ready to accept multiple connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A good entry point for your journey into the crazy world of concurrency: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)"&gt;multithreading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source code of this example is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/dissecting-a-web-stack-code/tree/master/3_concurrency_and_facades"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="34-issues"&gt;3.4 Issues&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#34-issues" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a Gunicorn we have now a production-ready HTTP server, and apparently implemented everything we need. There are still many considerations and missing pieces, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="performances-again"&gt;Performances (again)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#performances-again" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are 3 workers enough to sustain the load of our new killer mobile application? We expect thousands of visitors per minute, so maybe we should add some. But while we increase the amount of workers, we have to keep in mind that the machine we are using has a finite amount of CPU power and memory. So, once again, we have to focus on performances, and in particular on scalability: how can we keep adding workers without having to stop the application, replace the machine with a more powerful one, and restart the service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="embrace-change"&gt;Embrace change&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#embrace-change" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only problem we have to face in production. An important aspect of technology is that it changes over time, as new and (hopefully) better solutions become widespread. We usually design systems dividing them as much as possible into communicating layers exactly because we want to be free to replace a layer with something else, be it a simpler component or a more advanced one, one with better performances or maybe just a cheaper one. So, once again, we want to be able to evolve the underlying system keeping the same interface, exactly as we did in the case of web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="https_1"&gt;HTTPS&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#https_1" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another missing part of the system is HTTPS. Gunicorn and uWSGI do not understand the HTTPS protocol, so we need something in front of them that will deal with the "S" part of the protocol, leaving the "HTTP" part to the internal layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="load-balancers"&gt;Load balancers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#load-balancers" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a &lt;em&gt;load balancer&lt;/em&gt; is just a component in a system that distributes work among a pool of workers. Gunicorn is already distributing load among its workers, so this is not a new concept, but we generally want to do it on a bigger level, among machines or among entire systems. Load balancing can be hierarchical and be structured on many levels. We can also assign more importance to some components of the system, flagging them as ready to accept more load (for example because their hardware is better). Load balancers are extremely important in network services, and the definition of load can be extremely different from system to system: generally speaking, in a Web service the number of connections is the standard measure of the load, as we assume that on average all connections bring the same amount of work to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="reverse-proxies"&gt;Reverse proxies&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reverse-proxies" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load balancers are forward proxies, as they allow a client to contact any server in a pool. At the same time, a &lt;em&gt;reverse proxy&lt;/em&gt; allows a client to retrieve data produced by several systems through the same entry point. Reverse proxies are a perfect way to route HTTP requests to sub-systems that can be implemented with different technologies. For example, you might want to have part of the system implemented with Python, using Django and Postgres, and another part served by an AWS Lambda function written in Go and connected with a non-relational database such as DynamoDB. Usually, in HTTP services this choice is made according to the URL (for example routing every URL that begins with &lt;code&gt;/api/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="logic"&gt;Logic&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#logic" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want a layer that can implement a certain amount of logic, to manage simple rules that are not related to the service we implemented. A typical example is that of HTTP redirections: what happens if a user accesses the service with an &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; prefix instead of &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt;? The correct way to deal with this is through an HTTP 301 code, but you don't want such a request to reach your framework, wasting resources for such a simple task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4-the-web-server"&gt;4 The Web server&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#4-the-web-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="41-rationale"&gt;4.1 Rationale&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#41-rationale" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general label of &lt;em&gt;Web server&lt;/em&gt; is given to software that performs the tasks we discussed. Two very common choices for this part of the system are nginx and Apache, two open source projects that are currently leading the market. With different technical approaches, they both implement all the features we discussed in the previous section (and many more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="42-implementation"&gt;4.2 Implementation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#42-implementation" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test nginx without having to fight with the OS and install too many packages we can use Docker. Docker is useful to simulate a multi-machine environment, but it might also be your technology of choice for the actual production environment (AWS ECS works with Docker containers, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base configuration that we will run is very simple. One container will contain the Flask code and run the framework with Gunicorn, while the other container will run nginx. Gunicorn will serve HTTP on the internal port 8000, not exposed by Docker and thus not reachable from our browser, while nignx will expose port 80, the traditional HTTP port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same directory of the file &lt;code&gt;wsgi.py&lt;/code&gt;, create a &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;python:3.6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt; app /app
&lt;span class="k"&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt; wsgi.py /

&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN&lt;/span&gt; pip install flask gunicorn
&lt;span class="k"&gt;EXPOSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; 8000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This starts from a Python Docker image, adds the &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; directory and the &lt;code&gt;wsgi.py&lt;/code&gt; file, and installs Gunicorn. Now create a configuration for nginx in a file called &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;http://application:8000/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This defines a server that listens on port 80 and that connects all the URL starting with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; with a server called &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt; on port 8000, which is the container running Gunicorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, create a file &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; that will describe the configuration of the containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;3.7&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;expose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nginx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;nginx&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;8080:80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;depends_on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the name &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt; that we mentioned in the nginx configuration file is not a magic string, but is the name we assigned to the Gunicorn container in the Docker Compose configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this infrastructure we need to install Docker Compose in our virtual environment through &lt;code&gt;pip install docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;. I also created a file named &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; with the name of the project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;service
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point you can run Docker Compose with &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;service_default&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; with the default driver
Creating service_application_1 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Creating service_nginx_1       ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If everything is working correctly, opening the browser and visiting &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; should show you the HTML page Flask is serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;code&gt;docker-compose logs&lt;/code&gt; we can check what services are doing. We can recognise the output of Gunicorn in the logs of the service named &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose logs application
Attaching to service_application_1
application_1  &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-14 &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:35:42 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Starting gunicorn &lt;span class="m"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;.0.4

application_1  &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-14 &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:35:42 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Using worker: sync

application_1  &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-14 &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:35:42 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Booting worker with pid: &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
application_1  &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;-02-14 &lt;span class="m"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:35:42 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;INFO&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Booting worker with pid: &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;but the one we are mostly interested with now is the service named &lt;code&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt;, so let's follow the logs in real-time with &lt;code&gt;docker-compose logs -f nginx&lt;/code&gt;. Refresh the &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; page you visited with the browser, and the container should output something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose logs -f nginx
Attaching to service_nginx_1
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.192.1 - - &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:08:42:20 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which is the standard log format of nginx. It shows the IP address of the client (&lt;code&gt;192.168.192.1&lt;/code&gt;), the connection timestamp, the HTTP request and the response status code (200), plus other information on the client itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's now increase the number of services, to see the load balancing mechanism in action. To do this, first we need to change the log format of nginx to show the IP address of the machine that served the request. Change the &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; file adding the &lt;code&gt;log_format&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;access_log&lt;/code&gt; options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;log_format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;upstreamlog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$time_local]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;to:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$upstream_addr:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$status&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;http://application:8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;access_log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/var/log/nginx/access.log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;upstreamlog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$upstream_addr&lt;/code&gt; variable is the one that contains the IP address of the server proxied by nginx. Now run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose down&lt;/code&gt; to stop all containers and then &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d --scale application=3&lt;/code&gt; to start them again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose down
Stopping service_nginx_1       ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Stopping service_application_1 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Removing service_nginx_1       ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Removing service_application_1 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Removing network service_default
$ docker-compose up -d --scale &lt;span class="nv"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
Creating network &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;service_default&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; with the default driver
Creating service_application_1 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Creating service_application_2 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Creating service_application_3 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
Creating service_nginx_1       ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Docker Compose runs now 3 containers for the &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt; service. If you open the logs stream and visit the page in the browser you will now see a slightly different output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose logs -f nginx
Attaching to service_nginx_1
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:09:00:16 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; localhost to: &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.240.4:8000: GET / HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where you can spot &lt;code&gt;to: 192.168.240.4:8000&lt;/code&gt; which is the IP address of one of the application containers. If you now visit the page again multiple times you should notice a change in the upstream address, something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose logs -f nginx
Attaching to service_nginx_1
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:09:00:16 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; localhost to: &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.240.4:8000: GET / HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:09:00:17 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; localhost to: &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.240.2:8000: GET / HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:09:00:17 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; localhost to: &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.240.3:8000: GET / HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:09:00:17 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; localhost to: &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.240.4:8000: GET / HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
nginx_1        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;/Feb/2020:09:00:17 +0000&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; localhost to: &lt;span class="m"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.168.240.2:8000: GET / HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shows that nginx is performing load balancing, but to tell the truth this is happening through Docker's DNS, and not by an explicit action performed by the web server. We can verify this accessing the nginx container and running &lt;code&gt;dig application&lt;/code&gt; (you need to run &lt;code&gt;apt update&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apt install dnsutils&lt;/code&gt; to install &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see load balancing performed by nginx we can explicitly define two services and assign them different weights. Run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose down&lt;/code&gt; and change the nginx configuration to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;upstream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;weight=3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;log_format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;upstreamlog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$time_local]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;to:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$upstream_addr:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$status&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;http://app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;access_log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/var/log/nginx/access.log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;upstreamlog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We defined here an &lt;code&gt;upstream&lt;/code&gt; structure that lists two different services, &lt;code&gt;application1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;application2&lt;/code&gt;, giving to the first one a weight of 3. This mean that each 4 requests, 3 will be routed to the first service, and one to the second service. Now nginx is not just relying on the DNS, but consciously choosing between two different services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's define the services accordingly in the Docker Compose configuration file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;application1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gunicorn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--workers 6 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;application2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gunicorn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;nginx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nginx&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nginx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nginx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;depends_on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I basically duplicated the definition of &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt;, but the first service is running now 6 workers, just for the sake of showing a possible difference between the two. Now run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker-compose logs -f nginx&lt;/code&gt;. If you refresh the page on the browser multiple times you will see something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ docker-compose logs -f nginx

&lt;p&gt;where you can clearly notice the load balancing between &lt;code&gt;172.18.0.2&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;application1&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;172.18.0.3&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;application2&lt;/code&gt;) in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, finally we can say that the job is done. Now we have a production-ready web server in front of our multi-threaded web framework and we can focus on writing Python code instead of dealing with HTTP headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a web server allows us to scale the infrastructure just adding new instances behind it, without interrupting the service. The HTTP concurrent server runs multiple instances of our framework, and the framework itself abstracts HTTP, mapping it to our high-level language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bonus-cloud-infrastructures"&gt;Bonus: cloud infrastructures&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#bonus-cloud-infrastructures" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early years of the Internet, companies used to have their own servers on-premise, and system administrators used to run the whole stack directly on the bare operating system. Needless to say, this was complicated, expensive, and failure-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays "the cloud" is the way to go, so I want to briefly mention some components that can help you run such a web stack on AWS, which is the platform I know the most and the most widespread cloud provider in the world at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="elastic-beanstalk"&gt;Elastic Beanstalk&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#elastic-beanstalk" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the entry-level solution for simple applications, being a managed infrastructure that provides load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring. You can use several programming languages (among which Python and Node.js) and choose between different web servers like for example Apache or nginx. The components of an EB service are not hidden, but you don't have direct access to them, and you have to rely on configuration files to change the way they work. It's a good solution for simple services, but you will probably soon need more control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk"&gt;Go to Elastic Beanstalk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="elastic-container-service-ecs"&gt;Elastic Container Service (ECS)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#elastic-container-service-ecs" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ECS you can run Docker containers grouping them in clusters and setting up auto-scale policies connected with metrics coming from CloudWatch. You have the choice of running them on EC2 instances (virtual machines) managed by you or on a serverless infrastructure called Fargate. ECS will run your Docker containers, but you still have to create DNS entries and load balancers on your own. You also have the choice of running your containers on Kubernetes using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/"&gt;Go to Elastic Container Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="elastic-compute-cloud-ec2"&gt;Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#elastic-compute-cloud-ec2" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the bare metal of AWS, where you spin up stand-alone virtual machines or auto-scaling group of them. You can SSH into these instances and provide scripts to install and configure software. You can install here your application, web servers, databases, whatever you want. While this used to be the way to go at the very beginning of the cloud computing age I don't think you should go for it. There is so much a cloud provider can give you in terms of associated services like logs or monitoring, and in terms of performances, that it doesn't make sense to avoid using them. EC2 is still there, anyway, and if you run ECS on top of it you need to know what you can and what you can't do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Go to Elastic Compute Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="elastic-load-balancing"&gt;Elastic Load Balancing&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#elastic-load-balancing" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Network Load Balancers (NLB) manage pure TCP/IP connections, Application Load Balancers are dedicated to HTTP, and they can perform many of the services we need. They can reverse proxy through rules (that were recently improved) and they can terminate TLS, using certificates created in ACM (AWS Certificate Manager). As you can see, ALBs are a good replacement for a web server, even though they clearly lack the extreme configurability of a software. You can, however, use them as the first layer of load balancing, still using nginx or Apache behind them if you need some of the features they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network, that is a geographically-distributed cache that provides faster access to your content. While CDNs are not part of the stack that I discussed in this post I think it is worth mentioning CF as it can speed-up any static content, and also terminate TLS in connection with AWS Certificate Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

Please be warned that some of the matters discussed here, some solutions or the given code can be outdated by more recent Django versions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first two issues of this short series we wandered around the basic concepts of class-based views in Django, and started understanding and using two of the basic generic views Django makes available to you: &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;. Both are views that read some data from the database and show them on a rendered template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third issue wants to introduce the reader to the class-based version of Django forms. This post is not meant to be a full introduction to the Django form library; rather, I want to show how class-based generic views implement the CUD part of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), the Read one being implemented by "standard" generic views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-very-basic-example"&gt;A very basic example&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#a-very-basic-example" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start working with CBFs (class-based forms) let's say we are working with a &lt;code&gt;StickyNote&lt;/code&gt; class which represents a simple text note with a date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StickyNote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DateTimeField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TextField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we usually want to do is to build a form that allows the user to create a new entry in the database, in this case a new sticky note. The functional version of such a form would be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;note_add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StickyNoteForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_to_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;note_add.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;^note_add/$&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;note_add&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which is not too complex to grasp. Note that I left aside some imports; the &lt;code&gt;StickNoteForm&lt;/code&gt; class is built using a &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/modelforms/"&gt;model form&lt;/a&gt;. Since you &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/"&gt;already know&lt;/a&gt; how functional form views work, let's compare it with the same view expressed with a class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NoteAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CreateView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StickyNote&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise that most of the code went away, thanks to inheritance. As happened in the first two posts with standard views, the class mechanism provides us with a bunch of code that lives somewhere in the class hierarchy and works behind the scenes. Our mission is now to uncover that code to figure out how exactly CBFs work and how we can change them to perform what we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the post easier to follow, please always remember that "class-based form" is a short name for "class-based form view". That is, CBFs are views, so their job is to process incoming HTTP requests and return a HTTP response. Form views do this in a slightly different way than the standard ones, mostly due to the different nature of POST requests compared with GET ones. Let us take a look at this concept before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="http-requests-get-and-post"&gt;HTTP requests: GET and POST&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#http-requests-get-and-post" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that this is a broad subject and that the present section wants only to be a very quick review of the main concepts that are related to Django CBFs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP requests come in different forms, depending on the &lt;strong&gt;method&lt;/strong&gt; they carry. Those methods are called &lt;strong&gt;HTTP verbs&lt;/strong&gt; and the two most used ones are &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt;. The GET method tells the server that the client wants to retrieve a resource (the one connected with the relative URL) and shall have no side effects (such as changing the resource). The POST method is used to send some data to the server, the given URL being the &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; that shall handle the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the definition of POST is very broad: the server accepts the incoming data and is allowed to perform any type of action with it, such as creating a new entity, editing or deleting one or more of them, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that forms are not the same thing as POST request. As a matter of fact, they are connected just incidentally: a form is a way to collect data from a user browsing a HTML page while POST is the way that data is transmitted to the server. You do not need to have a form to make a POST request, you just need some data to send. HTML forms are just a useful way to send POST requests, but not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="form-views"&gt;Form views&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#form-views" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are form views different from standard views? The answer can be found looking at the flow of a typical data submission on a Web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user browses a web page (GET)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server answers the GET request with a page containing a form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user fills the form and submits it (POST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server receives and processes data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the procedure involves a double interaction with the server: the first request GETs the page, the second POSTs the data. So you need to build a view that answers the GET request and a view that answers the POST one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of the time the URL we use to POST data is the same URL we used to GET the page, we need to build a view that accepts both methods. This is the main reason of the pattern you are used to see in functional form views in Django. &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/"&gt;The official Django documentation&lt;/a&gt; on the subject uses this snippet of code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;POST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If the form has been submitted...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ContactForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A form bound to the POST data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# All validation rules pass&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Process the data in form.cleaned_data&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseRedirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/thanks/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Redirect after POST&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ContactForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# An unbound form&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;contact.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;form&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the first conditional path deals with the data submission (POST) while the else part deals with the usual case of a GET request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to dig into the class-based forms that Django provides us to understand how they deal with this double interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start with the &lt;code&gt;CreateView&lt;/code&gt; class we used in our simple example, which is defined in &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L202"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#202&lt;/a&gt;. It is an almost empty class that inherits from &lt;code&gt;SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin&lt;/code&gt; and from &lt;code&gt;BaseCreateView&lt;/code&gt;. The first class deals with the template selected to render the response and we can leave it aside for the moment. The second class, on the other hand, can be found a couple of lines above, at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L187"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L187&lt;/a&gt;, and implements two methods which names are self explaining, &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="processing-get-and-post-requests"&gt;Processing GET and POST requests&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#processing-get-and-post-requests" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already met the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;a href="https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2013/12/11/digging-up-django-class-based-views-2/"&gt;past article&lt;/a&gt; when we talked about the &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; class. A quick recap of its purpose: this method is called when the incoming HTTP request carries the GET verb and is used to process the request itself. Not surprisingly, the &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; method is called when the incoming request is a POST one. The two methods are already defined by an ancestor of the &lt;code&gt;BaseCreateView&lt;/code&gt; class, namely &lt;code&gt;ProcessFormView&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L145"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L145&lt;/a&gt;). It is useful to take a peek at the source code of this last class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProcessFormView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    A mixin that renders a form on GET and processes it on POST.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        Handles GET requests and instantiates a blank version of the form.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;render_to_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_context_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        Handles POST requests, instantiating a form instance with the passed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        POST variables and then checked for validity.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form_invalid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the two methods are pretty straightforward. They both retrieve the class of the form with &lt;code&gt;get_form_class()&lt;/code&gt; and instance it with &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt; (more on them later). The &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method then just calls the &lt;code&gt;render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt; method to render a template, passing the context produced by the &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; method. Note that the context receives the form as built by the &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; method does not directly render the template since it has to process incoming data before doing this last step. Instead the validation of the form is performed through its &lt;code&gt;is_valid()&lt;/code&gt; method and the two methods &lt;code&gt;form_valid()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;form_invalid()&lt;/code&gt; are called depending on the result of the test. See the &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/forms/validation/"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information about form validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the behaviour of these classes follows the same pattern of that used in &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; as described in the previous two posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ProcessFormView&lt;/code&gt; class inherits from &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;, which was already described in depth in the first two posts of this series; there you can find the &lt;code&gt;as_view()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method that are the foundation of the CBVs system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-form-workflow-part-i"&gt;The form workflow - part I&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-form-workflow-part-i" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inheritance path that starts with &lt;code&gt;ProcessFormView&lt;/code&gt; spans all the classes that deal with the incoming request, telling GET and POST methods apart. The second inheritance path we can follow from &lt;code&gt;BaseCreateView&lt;/code&gt; leads to &lt;code&gt;ModelFormMixin&lt;/code&gt;, which is defined at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L75"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L75&lt;/a&gt;. This path contains the classes that implement the form management methods. The first two methods that deal with the form are &lt;code&gt;get_form_class()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt; that we encountered when discussing the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;get_form_class()&lt;/code&gt; tries to get the form model from the &lt;code&gt;self.form_class&lt;/code&gt; attribute, and if this is not defined tries to extract the model from the &lt;code&gt;self.model&lt;/code&gt; or from the queryset. Then it returns a suitable modelform, using a factory defined in &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/models.py"&gt;forms/models.py&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt; method is defined in &lt;code&gt;FormMixin&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L10"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L10&lt;/a&gt;) and instances the form class with the keywords returned by &lt;code&gt;get_form_kwargs()&lt;/code&gt;, implemented in &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L100"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L100&lt;/a&gt;. This last method is quite important as we are going to discover in a short while, since it has a big role in the double interaction that happens with POST requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first implementation of the &lt;code&gt;get_form_kwargs()&lt;/code&gt; method that we find in the ancestors tree is in &lt;code&gt;ModelFormMixin&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L100"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L100&lt;/a&gt;), but this immediately calls the same method defined in &lt;code&gt;FormMixin&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L10"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L10&lt;/a&gt;). The code is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_form_kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;initial&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_initial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;POST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;PUT&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;files&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first value of the form keywords dictionary is the copy of the &lt;code&gt;self.initial&lt;/code&gt; dictionary, returned by &lt;code&gt;get_initial()&lt;/code&gt; as stated by &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/forms/api/#dynamic-initial-values"&gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Then, if the method of the request being processed is POST or PUT, the keywords are updated with the content of the request itself, i.e. posted data and uploaded files. This is used to initialize the form object itself as you can see at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/forms.py#L77"&gt;forms/forms.py#L77&lt;/a&gt;, and I am going to describe this mechanism later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this method returns its dictionary, the execution continues in &lt;code&gt;ModelFormMixin&lt;/code&gt;. The code of that method is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_form_kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ModelFormMixin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form_kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;instance&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;that just adds &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt; key of the keywords dictionary. We already met &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; when discussing &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;, where it contained the result of the queryset, i.e. the object being shown by the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; now? Among the ancestors of our &lt;code&gt;CreateView&lt;/code&gt; class, &lt;code&gt;BaseCreateView&lt;/code&gt; defines &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; so for the moment we can leave it aside. It will come to the rescue later, when we will discuss update and deletion forms, so do not forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last things we find in the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method, just after &lt;code&gt;get_form_class()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt;, is &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt;. As happened in &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;, this method builds a dictionary (the context) that is used to render a template. You can find the implementation of &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L130"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L130&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see, since &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; has been set to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, the context contains only the instanced form under the &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; keyword (inserted at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L155"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L155&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's recap the process until here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The URL dispatcher requests with GET a page containing a form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;ProcessFormView&lt;/code&gt; finds the form class of choice through &lt;code&gt;get_form_class()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The form class is instanced by &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt; with the values contained in the &lt;code&gt;self.initial&lt;/code&gt; dictionary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point a template is rendered with a context returned by &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; as usual. The context contains the form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-form-workflow-part-ii"&gt;The form workflow - part II&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#the-form-workflow-part-ii" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the user obtained the requested page and is facing an empty form. Once the form has been filled, he or she clicks the submit button and a new HTTP request reaches the server, this time carrying the POST method and a set of data taken from the input fields of the form itself. Our view shall now handle the second interaction step, the one that in functional views is usually managed by the part starting with &lt;code&gt;if request.method == 'POST':&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we already know, the incoming request is processed by the &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;ProcessFormView&lt;/code&gt;, which works like the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method in its first part, calling &lt;code&gt;get_form_class()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_form()&lt;/code&gt;. The latter method now deals with a POST request, so the code of &lt;code&gt;get_form_kwargs()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;FormMixin&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L10"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L10&lt;/a&gt;) adds to the keywords dictionary the submitted data with the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; key and the uploaded files under the &lt;code&gt;files&lt;/code&gt; key. Why does Django do this? Well, as you can see at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/forms.py#L77"&gt;forms/forms.py#L77&lt;/a&gt; a Django form can be instanced with an optional &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which is stored inside the form object for the subsequent validation phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the form is bound (that is, it contains some data or files - see &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/forms.py#L80"&gt;forms/forms.py#L80&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; method now tests the result of &lt;code&gt;is_valid()&lt;/code&gt; and acts accordingly calling either &lt;code&gt;form_valid()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;form_invalid()&lt;/code&gt;. Pay attention that, while &lt;code&gt;is_valid()&lt;/code&gt; is a method of the form itself, the two latter methods belong to the &lt;code&gt;BaseCreateView&lt;/code&gt;, defined by the same ancestor classes that implement &lt;code&gt;get_form_kwargs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ModelFormMixin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FormMixin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former class implements it at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L123"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L123&lt;/a&gt; and puts the result of &lt;code&gt;form.save()&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt;. Remember that &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; is appended to the context under the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; key by the &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; method, as shown in the previous section. The &lt;code&gt;form.save()&lt;/code&gt; method for modelforms is defined by &lt;code&gt;BaseModelForm&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/models.py#L357"&gt;forms/models.py#L357&lt;/a&gt; and basically saves the instance of the Django model connected with the modelform, that is implements the actual creation at the base of the &lt;code&gt;CreateView&lt;/code&gt; form view. As &lt;code&gt;form.save()&lt;/code&gt; returns the object saved to the database, it makes sense to store it in &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; and pass it to the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The execution of &lt;code&gt;form_valid()&lt;/code&gt; continues with the implementation in the &lt;code&gt;FormMixin&lt;/code&gt; class at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L61"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L61&lt;/a&gt;. This method returns a &lt;code&gt;HttpResponseRedirect&lt;/code&gt; object, which is the way you make the browser point to the given URL in Django. In this case the URL is given by &lt;code&gt;self.get_success_url()&lt;/code&gt; which tries to return &lt;code&gt;self.success_url&lt;/code&gt; if defined, otherwise returns the result of &lt;code&gt;get_absolute_url()&lt;/code&gt; for the fresh-made object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;form_invalid()&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L67"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L67&lt;/a&gt; deals with the case of a form containing some errors and simply calls &lt;code&gt;render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt; passing it the context with the compiled form under the &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-and-delete-operations"&gt;Update and Delete operations&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#update-and-delete-operations" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rather rich code tour unveiled the inner mechanism of the &lt;code&gt;CreateView&lt;/code&gt; class, which can be used to create a new object in the database. The &lt;code&gt;UpdateView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DeleteView&lt;/code&gt; classes follow a similar path, with minor changes to perform the different action they are implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UpdateView&lt;/code&gt; wants to show the form already filled with values, so it instances &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt; before processing the request (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L210"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L210&lt;/a&gt;). This makes the object available in the keywords dictionary under the &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt; key (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L105"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L105&lt;/a&gt;), which is used by modelforms to initialize the data (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/models.py#L244"&gt;forms/models.py#L244&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;form.save()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;BaseModelForm&lt;/code&gt; is smart enough to understand if the object has been created or just changed (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/forms/models.py#L365"&gt;forms/models.py#L365&lt;/a&gt; so the &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;UpdateView&lt;/code&gt; works just like the one of &lt;code&gt;CreateView&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DeleteView&lt;/code&gt; is a bit different from &lt;code&gt;CreateView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UpdateView&lt;/code&gt;. As &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#deleteview"&gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt; states, if called with a GET method it shows a confirmation page that POSTs to the same URL. So, as for the GET requests, &lt;code&gt;DeleteView&lt;/code&gt; just uses the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method defined by its ancestor &lt;code&gt;BaseDetailView&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/detail.py#L103"&gt;views/generic/detail.py#L103&lt;/a&gt;), which renders the template putting the object in the context. When called with a POST request, the view uses the &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; method defined by &lt;code&gt;DeletionMixin&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L233"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L233&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn just calls the &lt;code&gt;delete()&lt;/code&gt; method of the same class (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L239"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L239&lt;/a&gt;). This performs the deletion on the database and redirects to the success URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the structure behind the current implementation of Django class-based form views is rather complex. This allows the user to achieve complex behaviours like the CUD operations just by defining a couple of classes as I did in the simple example at the beginning of the post. Most of the time, however, such a simplification makes it difficult for the programmer to understand how to achieve the desired changes to the class behaviour. So the purpose of this big tour I made inside the Django source code was to give an insight of what methods are called in the lifetime of your HTTP request so that you can better identify what methods you need to override.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performing special actions that fall outside the standard CUD operations you better inherit from &lt;code&gt;FormView&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/edit.py#L181"&gt;views/generic/edit.py#L181&lt;/a&gt;). The first thing to do is to check if and how you need to customize the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; methods; remember that you either need to implement the full behaviour of those methods or make you changes and call the parent implementation. If this is not enough for your application consider overriding one of the more dedicated methods, such as &lt;code&gt;get_form_kwargs()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;form_valid()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first installment of this short series, I introduced the theory behind Django class-based views and the reason why in this context classes are more powerful than pure functions. I also introduced one of the generic views Django provides out-of-the-box, which is &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second post I want to talk about the second most used generic view, &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;, and about custom querysets and arguments. Last, I'm going to introduce unspecialized class-based views that allow you to build more complex Web pages. To fully understand &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;, however, you need to grasp two essential concepts, namely &lt;strong&gt;querysets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;view parameters&lt;/strong&gt;. So I'm sorry for the learn-by-doing readers, but this time too I'm going to start with some pure programming topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="querysets-or-the-art-of-extracting-information"&gt;QuerySets or the art of extracting information&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#querysets-or-the-art-of-extracting-information" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important parts of Django is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper), which allows you to access the underlying database just like a collection of Python objects. As you know, Django provides you tools to simplify the construction of DB queries; they are &lt;strong&gt;managers&lt;/strong&gt; (the &lt;code&gt;.objects&lt;/code&gt; attribute of any models, for example) and &lt;strong&gt;query methods&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, and friends). Pay attention because things here are slightly more magical than you can think at a first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use one of the methods of a manager you get as a result a &lt;code&gt;QuerySet&lt;/code&gt;, which most of the time is used as a list, but is more than this. You can find &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/db/queries/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/models/querysets/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; the official documentation about queries and QuerySets, a very recommended reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to stress here is that QuesySets are not evaluated until you perform an action that access the content like slicing or iterating on it. This means that we can build QuerySets, pass them to functions, store them, and even build them programmatically or metaprogramming them without the DB being hit. If you think at QuerySets as recipes you are not far from the truth: they are objects that store how you want to retrieve the data of your interest. Actually retriving them is another part of the game. This separation between the definition of something and its execution is called &lt;strong&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a very trivial example to show why the lazy evaluation of QuerySets is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_oldest_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;old_books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_oldest_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;old_hardcover_books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; \
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_oldest_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type=Book.HARDCOVER&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the &lt;code&gt;get_oldest_three()&lt;/code&gt; method is just filtering an incoming QuerySet (which can be of any type); it simply orders the objects and gets the first three inserted in the DB. The important thing here is that we are using QuerySets like pure 'algorithms', or descriptions of a procedure. When creating the &lt;code&gt;old_books&lt;/code&gt; variable we are just telling the &lt;code&gt;get_oldest_three()&lt;/code&gt; method "Hey, this is the way I extract the data I'm interested in. May you please refine it and return the actual data?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being such flexible objects, QuerySets are an important part of generic views, so keep them warm for the upcoming banquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="being-flexible-parametric-views"&gt;Being flexible: parametric views&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#being-flexible-parametric-views" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs are the API of our Web site or service. This can be more or less evident for the user that browses through the pages, but from the programmer's point of view URLs are the entry points of a computer system. As such, they are not very different from the API of a library: here, static pages are just like constants, or functions that always return that same value (such as a configuration parameter), while dynamic pages are like functions that process incoming data (parameters) and return a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Web URLs can accept parameters, and our underlying view shall do the same. You basically have three methods to convey parameters from the user's browser to your server using HTTP. The first method is named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string"&gt;query string&lt;/a&gt; and lists parameters directly in the URL through a universal syntax. The second method is storing parameters in the HTTP request body, which is what POST requests do. We will discuss this method in a later post about forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first method has one big drawback: most of the time URLs are long (and sometimes &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; long), and difficult to use as a real API. To soften this effect the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL"&gt;clean URL&lt;/a&gt; arose, and this is the way Django follows natively (though, if you want, you can also stick to the query string method).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/http/urls/"&gt;you know&lt;/a&gt; that you can collect parameters contained in the URL parsing it with a regular expression; what we need to discover is how class-based views receive and process them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous post we already discussed the &lt;code&gt;as_view()&lt;/code&gt; method that shall instance the class and return the result of &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L46"&gt;views/generic/base.py#L46&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classonlymethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;as_view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;initkwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        Main entry point for a request-response process.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# sanitize keyword arguments&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;initkwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_method_names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;You tried to pass in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; method name as a &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;keyword argument to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;(). Don&amp;#39;t do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hasattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;() received an invalid keyword &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;. as_view &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;only accepts arguments that are already &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;attributes of the class.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;initkwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hasattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;get&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hasattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;head&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# take name and docstring from class&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;update_wrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;updated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and possible attributes set by decorators&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# like csrf_exempt from dispatch&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;update_wrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;assigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now look at what the &lt;code&gt;view()&lt;/code&gt; wrapper function actually does with the instanced class (here line 21, &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L65"&gt;views/generic/base.py#L65&lt;/a&gt;); not surprisingly it takes the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kwargs&lt;/code&gt; passed by the URLconf passes and converts them into as many class attributes with the same names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;em&gt;everywhere in our CBVs&lt;/em&gt; we can access the original call parameters simply reading &lt;code&gt;self.request&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;self.args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;self.kwargs&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;*args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;**kwargs&lt;/code&gt; are the unnamed and named values extracted by the URLconf regular expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="details"&gt;Details&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#details" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after listing things, one of the most useful things a Web site does is giving details about objects. Obviously any e-commerce site is made for the most part by pages that list products and show product details, but also a blog is made of one or more pages with a list of posts and a page for each of them. So building a detailed view of the content of our database is worth learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us in this task Django provides &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;, which indeed deals, as the name suggests, with the details of what we get from the DB. While &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;'s basic behaviour is to extract the list of all objects with a given model, &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; extracts a single object. How does it know what object shall be extracted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; is called on an incoming HTTP request the only thing it does is to look at the &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which for &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; objects contains the name of the HTTP verb used (e.g. &lt;code&gt;'GET'&lt;/code&gt;); then &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; looks for a method of the class with the lowercase name of the verb (e.g. &lt;code&gt;'GET'&lt;/code&gt; --&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt;) (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L78"&gt;views/generic/base.py#L78&lt;/a&gt;). This handler is then called with the same parameters of &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt;, namely the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; itself, &lt;code&gt;*args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;**kwargs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; has no body and inherits everything from two classes; the second one, &lt;code&gt;BaseDetailView&lt;/code&gt;, implements the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/detail.py#L107"&gt;views/generic/detail.py#L107&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_context_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;render_to_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see this method extracts the single object it shall represent calling &lt;code&gt;self.get_object()&lt;/code&gt;, then calls &lt;code&gt;self.get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; (that we met in the previous post) and last the familiar &lt;code&gt;self.render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt; that is the class equivalent of the well know Django function. The method &lt;code&gt;self.get_object()&lt;/code&gt; is provided by &lt;code&gt;BaseDetailView&lt;/code&gt;'s ancestor &lt;code&gt;SingleObjectMixin&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/detail.py#L10"&gt;generic/detail.py#L10&lt;/a&gt;): the most important parts of its code, for the sake of our present topic are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;pk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pk_url_kwarg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: I removed many lines from the previous function to improve readability; please check the original source code for the complete implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code shows where &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; gets the queryset from; the &lt;code&gt;get_queryset()&lt;/code&gt; method is provided by &lt;code&gt;SingleObjectMixin&lt;/code&gt; itself and basically returns &lt;code&gt;self.queryset&lt;/code&gt; if present, otherwise returns all objects of the given model (acting just like &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; does). This &lt;code&gt;queryset&lt;/code&gt; is then refined by a &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and last by a &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt;. Here &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; is not used directly (I think) to manage the different error cases and raise the correct exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameter &lt;code&gt;pk&lt;/code&gt; used in &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; comes directly from &lt;code&gt;self.kwargs&lt;/code&gt;, so it is taken directly from the URL. Since this is a core concept of views in general I want to look at this part carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; is called by an URLconf that provides a regular expression to parse the URL, for example &lt;code&gt;url(r'^(?P&amp;lt;pk&amp;gt;\d+)/$',&lt;/code&gt;. This regex extracts a parameter and gives it the name &lt;code&gt;pk&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;kwargs&lt;/code&gt; of the view will contain &lt;code&gt;pk&lt;/code&gt; as key and the actual number in the URL as value. For example the URL &lt;code&gt;123/&lt;/code&gt; will result in &lt;code&gt;{'pk': 123}&lt;/code&gt;. The default behaviour of &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; is to look for a &lt;code&gt;pk&lt;/code&gt; key and use it to perform the filtering of the queryset, since &lt;code&gt;self.pk_url_kwarg&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;'pk'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we want to change the name of the parameter we can simply define the &lt;code&gt;pk_url_kwarg&lt;/code&gt; of our class and provide a regex that extract the primary key with the new name. For example &lt;code&gt;url(r'^(?P&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;\d+)/$',&lt;/code&gt; extracts it with the name &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;, so we will define &lt;code&gt;pk_url_kwarg = 'key'&lt;/code&gt; in our class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this quick exploration we learned that a class inheriting from &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides a context with the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; key initialized to a single object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be configured with a &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; class attribute, to know what objects to extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; be configured with a &lt;code&gt;queryset&lt;/code&gt; class attribute, to refine the set of objects where the single object is extracted from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be called from a URL that includes a regexp that extracts the primary key of the searched object as &lt;code&gt;pk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; be configured to use a different name for the primary key through the &lt;code&gt;pk_url_kwarg&lt;/code&gt; class attribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic use of &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; is thus exemplified by the following code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;BookDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DetailView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;^(?P&amp;lt;pk&amp;gt;\d+)/$&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;BookDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;as_view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;detail&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The view extracts a single object with the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; model; the regex is configured with the standard &lt;code&gt;pk&lt;/code&gt; name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown for &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; in the previous post, any CBV uses &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; to return the context dictionary to the rendering engine. So views that inherit from &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; can add data to the context following the same pattern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;BookDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DetailView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_context_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BookDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_context_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;similar&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_similar_books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;^(?P&amp;lt;pk&amp;gt;\d+)/$&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;BookDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;as_view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;detail&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As explained before, you can access the object being shown through &lt;code&gt;self.object&lt;/code&gt;, which in the above example is passed to a service function we implemented somewhere in our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="using-the-base-views"&gt;Using the base views&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-base-views" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when dealing with complex pages, the generic display CBVs that Django provides are not the right choice. This usually becomes evident when you start overriding method to prevent the view to perform its standard behaviour. As an instance say that you want to show detailed information of more than one object: probably DetailView will soon show its limits, being built to show only one object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all those cases that cannot be easily solved by one of the generic display CBVs, your way goes through other classes: &lt;code&gt;RedirectView&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TemplateView&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;. The documentation for these base views is &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/base/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, while the source code is in &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py"&gt;views/generic/base.py&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to fully describe those views; I want however to briefly point out some peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; is by now an old friend of us; we met it when we discussed the &lt;code&gt;as_view()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method. It is the most generic view class and can be leveraged to perform very specialized tasks such as rendering pages without templates (for example when returning JSON data in AJAX techniques).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;TemplateView&lt;/code&gt; is the best choice to render pages from a template keeping in the meanwhile freedom as regards the context content. Chances are that this is going to be the view you will use the most after &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt;. Basically you just need to inherit from it and define the &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; method. As you can see from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L147"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;TemplateView&lt;/code&gt; answers to GET requests only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RedirectView&lt;/code&gt;, as the name implies, is used to redirect a request. The redirection mechanism is very simple: its &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method returns a &lt;code&gt;HttpResponseRedirect&lt;/code&gt; to the URL defined by the &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; class attribute. The class exhibits a very interesting behaviour (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L195"&gt;views/generic/base.py#L195&lt;/a&gt;) when called through HTTP methods other than GET (namely HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, DELETE, and PUT): it "converts" the method to GET simply calling &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; from the respective method (&lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt;, and so on). In the next post I'll show how to leverage this simple technique to show the user a prefilled form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="date-based-views"&gt;Date-based views&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#date-based-views" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django provides other class-based views that simplify dealing with objects extracted or ordered by date. As a programmer, you know that dealing with dates is sometimes at least awkward; the views in &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/dates.py"&gt;views/generic/dates.py&lt;/a&gt; aims to help you to tame your date-based objects; any object that contains a date (e.g. post date for articles, birth date for people, log date for messages, etc) can be processed by these views. You can find the official documentation &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/generic-date-based/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that date-based views are CBVs, so they are based on &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;, just like &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TemplateView&lt;/code&gt;. So, apart from their specialization on date processing, they behave the same (&lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt;, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we covered &lt;code&gt;DetailView&lt;/code&gt; in deep and, more quickly, all the remaining base and data-based views. In the next post we will step into the rich (and strange) world of forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post refers to Django 1.5. Please be warned that some of the matters discussed here, some solutions or the given code can be outdated by more recent Django versions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django programmers that started with versions prior to 1.3 are used to deal with views as functions, and they learned how to process even complex forms in a procedural way. From the release 1.3, Django introduced class-based views (CBVs) and ported its powerful generic views to this new paradigm (class-based generic views, or CBGVs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change, however, has not been harmless for Django novices: the django-users mailing list and StackOverflow are full of questions about views and classes, and the official documentation on this topic is still a little unorganized. Well, open source things are always ready to be improved, aren't they? This post aims to share some thoughts and insights about CBVs, and hopefully it can also lead to an improvement of the official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all Django developers for their work. Despite the previous criticism on documentation, this post wants to be a thanksgiving for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-cbvs"&gt;What are CBVs?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-cbvs" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class-based views are, indeed, (Django) views based on (Python) classes. Until here, it makes sense, hopefully. This means that, to master them, you need to understand both Django views and Python classes, so let's give a quick definition of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Django view is a piece of code that processes an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. Oh yes, nothing more, nothing less.
A Python class is the implementation of the Object-Oriented concept of class in the Python language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a view just need to be a &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#callable"&gt;callable&lt;/a&gt;, and this includes functions and classes. Thus, to understand the advantages of class-based views over function-based views we shall discuss the merits of classes over functions. The latter sentence could be the title of a 10 volumes book on programming (followed by another 10 volumes book titled "Merits of functions over classes"), so I am just going to scratch the surface of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="starting-off-with-python-classes"&gt;Starting off with Python classes&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#starting-off-with-python-classes" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of a class is implementing encapsulation: they represent a way of coupling data and functions. Doing this, a class loses the dynamic essence of a procedure, which exists only while it is running, and becomes a living entity, something that sits there, caring for its data, and reacts when we call its functions (methods).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy for a class is a finite-state machine: once the class has been initialized, methods are what we use to make it move between states. If we do not call methods, the class simply waits there without complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, let's look at a very simple procedure that takes a list and extracts the even numbers from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;extract_even_numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The example is very trivial, but I think there is always time to tangle up the code, so let us start with simple things. A class version of this function could be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EvenExtractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alist&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;extract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Seems to be the same thing, doesn't it? Indeed the difference is subtle but remarkable. Now the extractor has two parts, the first being the initialization and the second being the actual extraction, and we can have the class in one of three states: before initialization (&lt;code&gt;e = EvenExtractor&lt;/code&gt;), after initialization (&lt;code&gt;e = EvenExtractor(range(120))&lt;/code&gt;), and after extraction (&lt;code&gt;l = e.extract()&lt;/code&gt;. Being a finite-state machine we can interact with it before moving from a state to another. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EvenExtractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# State B&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# State C&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, despite the very simple example the point is: by converting the procedure to a class we obtained a rich tool that can execute its job step by step and, in general, can work in a non linear way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="playing-with-genetics"&gt;Playing with genetics&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#playing-with-genetics" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real power of classes used as finite-state machines lies in the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29"&gt;inheritance&lt;/a&gt;. Inheritance is a mechanism through which a class can copy another class and then change only the parts that have to behave differently. Please note that here we talk about classes and not instances, so the copy action here refers to the structure of the class, not the actual data contained in it. Inheritance is a mean to mimic the behaviour of a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sidenote: &lt;em&gt;I am a strong supporter of an OO design principle that states "Favour composition over inheritance" (and favor "favor" over "favour" for US audience). I read too many OOP introductions that stress too much the inheritance mechanism and leave composition aside, raising a generation of OOP programmers that, instead of building systems populated by many small collaborating objects create nightmares infested by giant all-purpose things that sometimes resemble an operating system more than a system component. Given that, inheritance plays an important role in OOP, and here we find a very good example of its real benefit.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's continue the above example, first by enriching the EvenExtractor class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EvenExtractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;extract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now the class performs an important action in its initialization phase, converting all elements of the input list to integers, and we can happily use it in our Next Big Project™. Some days after this change we realize that we could also profitably use a class that extracts odd elements form a list. Being good object oriented programmers we write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;OddExtractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;EvenExtractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;extract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and call it a day. Indeed, through the inheritance mechanism expressed by that &lt;code&gt;(EvenExtractor)&lt;/code&gt; signature of the new class, we defined something that is exactly the same thing as &lt;code&gt;EvenExtractor&lt;/code&gt;, with the same methods and attributes, but with a different name. Then we changed the behaviour of the new class but only for the extraction part by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding"&gt;overriding the method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the lesson: using classes and inheritance you can build finite-state machines that are easily customizable to suit your exact needs. This obviously is just one of the many points of view under which you can consider classes, but it is the one we need to understand Django CBVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="back-to-django"&gt;Back to Django&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#back-to-django" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally! You couldn't take Python classes anymore, could you? Sorry, we are dealing with them further, but for the moment let us move to Django to look at a practical use of what we learned in the previous sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Django view is a perfect example of a finite-state machine. It takes an incoming request and makes it flow through different processing steps until a final response is produced, which is then sent back to the user. So, for the love of definitions, say that CBVs are the Django mechanism to allow the programmer to write their views leveraging the tools made available by the object-oriented paradigm. In this context (pun intended) CBGVs are the "batteries included" of Django views: (class-based) generic views are powerful tools that the framework gives you to accomplish the most usual tasks, and sometimes even the unusual ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dig into one of the examples of the official Django docs; &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#listview"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; you find the API of the beloved &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;, a generic view to deal with a list of things (extracted from the database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.views.generic.list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;articles.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This example assumes that &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt; is your application and &lt;code&gt;Article&lt;/code&gt; is one of its models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short piece of code leverages the full power of inheritance. Indeed we just derived &lt;code&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; and changed the class attribute &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt;: how can this work? How can this class process incoming requests and what are the outputs? The official documentation states "While this view is executing, self.object_list will contain the list of objects (usually, but not necessarily a queryset) that the view is operating upon."; this leaves many dark corners, however, and if you are a novice, chances are that you are already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/code&gt; derives from &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;, the latter is the class we have to analyze to understand how data are processed. To do this you need to look at the &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#django.views.generic.list.ListView"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, and if something is still unclear you can freely look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/list.py"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;. As already said I find a little difficult to find a clear way through the docs, so I'll try to summarize here what I learned. In the following paragraphs you will find links like (&lt;a href=""&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;) which point to the source code, if you want to read it by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="url-dispatchers-and-views"&gt;URL dispatchers and views&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#url-dispatchers-and-views" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CBV cannot directly be used in your URL dispatcher; instead you have to give the result of the &lt;code&gt;as_view()&lt;/code&gt; method (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L31"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;), which basically defines a function that instances the class (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L46"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;) and calls the &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L47"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;); then the function is returned to be used in the URL dispatcher (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L55"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;). As a user, we are interested only in the fact that the &lt;em&gt;entry point&lt;/em&gt; of the class, i.e. the method called when a request hits the URL linked with it, is &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use this knowledge to print out a string on the console each time a request is served by our CBV. I'm running through this (indeed simple) task step by step since it shows exactly how you have to deal with CBVs when solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we define the &lt;code&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/code&gt; class this way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.views.generic.list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;articles.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;the class does not change its behaviour. What we did was to override the &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method with a call to the parent's method, i.e. we explicitly wrote what Python does by default. You can find detailed information about &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#super"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please be also sure to understand the star and double star notation to define variable number of arguments; the official documentation is &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since views are automatically called by the framework, the latter expects them to comply with a very specific API, so when overriding a method you have to obey its signature. The signature of &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/base/#django.views.generic.base.View.dispatch"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; by the way, this documentation of &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; gives you good hints about the internal working mechanism of CBVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method receives a &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; argument, which type is &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;), and we can print it on the console with the standard &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.views.generic.list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;articles.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This prints the content of the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object on the standard output of the Python code, that is on the standard output of the server that is running the Django project. If you are running the Django development server, you will find the output on the text console where you issued the &lt;code&gt;django-admin.py runserver&lt;/code&gt; command (or &lt;code&gt;manage.py runserver&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, in a nutshell, is the standard way of dealing with framework classes, and thus with Django's CBGVs: inherit from a predefined class, identify which methods you need to change, override them complying with their signature and calling the parent's code somewhere in the new code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full list of methods &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; uses when processing incoming requests is listed on its &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#listview"&gt;official documentation page&lt;/a&gt; in the "Method Flowchart" section; in the "Ancestors (MRO)" section you can see that &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; itself inherits from a good number of other classes. MRO stands for Method Resolution Order and has to deal with multiple inheritance: if you are eager to deal with one of the most intricate Python topics feel free to read &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="incoming-get-requests"&gt;Incoming GET requests&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#incoming-get-requests" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our &lt;code&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; method of the parent reads the &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object and selects a handler to process the request itself (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L57"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;): this means that if &lt;code&gt;request.method&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;'GET'&lt;/code&gt;, which is the HTTP way to say that we are &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; a resource, &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; will call the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; comes from its &lt;code&gt;BaseListView&lt;/code&gt; ancestor (&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#django.views.generic.list.BaseListView"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/list.py#L114"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;). This function is the one that contains the functional view code, so if you are accustomed to function-based views you'll find yourself at home here. As you can see, the function basically fills the attribute &lt;code&gt;self.object_list&lt;/code&gt; with the result of the method &lt;code&gt;self.get_queryset()&lt;/code&gt;, creates a context calling the method &lt;code&gt;self.get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; and calls the class version of &lt;code&gt;render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt;, namely &lt;code&gt;self.render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you still with me? Don't give up, we are nearly at the end (with ListView). The method &lt;code&gt;self.get_queryset()&lt;/code&gt; comes from the &lt;code&gt;MultipleObjectMixin&lt;/code&gt; ancestor of &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/mixins-multiple-object/#multipleobjectmixin"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/list.py#L11"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;) and simply gets all objects of a given model (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/list.py#L29"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;) issuing &lt;code&gt;queryset = self.model._default_manager.all()&lt;/code&gt;. The value of &lt;code&gt;self.model&lt;/code&gt; is what we configured in our class when we wrote &lt;code&gt;model = Article&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all. Our &lt;code&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/code&gt; class extracts all &lt;code&gt;Article&lt;/code&gt; objects from the database, and calls a template passing a context that contains a single variable, &lt;code&gt;object_list&lt;/code&gt;, instanced with the list of extracted objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="templates-and-contexts"&gt;Templates and contexts&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#templates-and-contexts" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you satisfied? I'm actually still curious about the template and the context. Let's see what we can find about these topics. First of all, when the class calls &lt;code&gt;self.render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt; it uses the code that comes from its &lt;code&gt;TemplateResponseMixin&lt;/code&gt; ancestor (&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/class-based-views/mixins-simple/#templateresponsemixin"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L81"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;); the method calls some other functions but its basic behaviour is to create a response using a template and a context. The template, again through a series of calls which you can follow by yourself, comes from &lt;code&gt;self.template_name&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L109"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;); while &lt;code&gt;TemplateResponseMixin&lt;/code&gt; defines it &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.5.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L85"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; does some magic through ancestors (&lt;a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.3.x/django/views/generic/list.py#L128"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;) to return a template which name derives from the given model. So, in short, our &lt;code&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/code&gt;, defining an &lt;code&gt;Article&lt;/code&gt; model, automatically uses a template that is called &lt;code&gt;article_list.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we change this behaviour? Of course! This is, after all, the point of using classes instead of functions: easily customize the behaviour. We can change the definition of our class like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.views.generic.list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;articles.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;sometemplate.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does this exactly do? When the &lt;code&gt;self.render_to_response()&lt;/code&gt; method looks for &lt;code&gt;self.template_name&lt;/code&gt; this attribute has a value, so there is no need to call the predefined methods and &lt;code&gt;sometemplate.html&lt;/code&gt; becomes the name of the template used to render the response. This follows a very useful pattern of object-oriented programming; if you are interested I can write something about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regards the context, remember that it is only a dictionary of values you want to access when compiling the template. Variable names inside the context (as thus inside the template), data format and data content are completely up to you. When using CBGVs, however, you will find in your context some variables that have been created by the ancestors of your view, as happens for &lt;code&gt;object_list&lt;/code&gt;. What if you want to show a page with the list of all Articles, but you want to add a value to the context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is easier: you just need to override the function that produces the context and change its behaviour. Say, for example, that we want to show the number of total readers of our site, along with the list of articles. Assuming that a &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; model is available we can write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.views.generic.list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;articles.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Reader&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_context_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ArticleListView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_context_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;readers&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Reader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As always, when overriding a method we first call the ancestor's one, so that we get the result expected from a normal behaviour of the method, then we add out customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first post I tried to uncover some of the mysteries behind CBVs and CBGVs in Django, by showing step by step what happens to a GET request that hits a class-based view. Hopefully the matter has now been demystified a little!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next posts I will discuss DetailView, the generic view to show detail about an object, how to create custom CBVs and how to use CBVs to process forms, i.e. POST requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if this post helped you in understanding the matter and feel free to point out any error or to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013-10-29: As pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mbrochh"&gt;mbrochh&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit, there is a very useful resource for Django programmers: &lt;a href="http://ccbv.co.uk/"&gt;Classy Class-Based Views&lt;/a&gt;. It is a comprensive index of all CBGVs with ancestors and method signatures. Make sure to have it in you Django bookmarks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013-10-29: I fixed a couple of typos when overriding &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt;. Thanks to Tom Evans for spotting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013-10-30: Fixed the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;EvenExtractor&lt;/code&gt;, that was missing the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; parameter. Thanks &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/meatypocket"&gt;meatypocket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015-06-10: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/meatypocket"&gt;meatypocket&lt;/a&gt; spotted a missing &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; override. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
