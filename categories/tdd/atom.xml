The well-known Uncle Bob talks a lot about this concept at conferences and wrote some very interesting posts about it. What he calls "Clean Architecture" is a way of structuring a software system, a set of consideration (more than strict rules) about the different layers and the role of the actors in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he clearly states in a post aptly titled &lt;a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;The Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, the idea behind this design is not new, being built on a set of concepts that have been pushed by many software engineers over the last 3 decades. One of the first implementations may be found in the Boundary-Control-Entity model proposed by Ivar Jacobson in his masterpiece "Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach" published in 1992, but Martin lists other more recent versions of this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not repeat here what he had already explained better than I can do, so I will just point out some resources you may check to start exploring these concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;The Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; a post by Robert Martin that concisely describes the goals of the architecture. It also lists resources that describe similar architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/12/TheOpenClosedPrinciple.html"&gt;The Open Closed Principle&lt;/a&gt; a post by Robert Martin not strictly correlated with the Clean Architecture concept but important for the separation concept.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;(upcoming) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Architecture-Robert-C-Martin-x/dp/0134494164/ref=la_B000APG87E_1_3?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1479146201&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Martin, published by Prentice Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to show how to build a web service in Python from scratch using a clean architecture. One of the main advantages of this layered design is testability, so I will develop it following a TDD approach. The project was initially developed from scratch in around 3 hours of work. Given the toy nature of the project some choices have been made to simplify the resulting code. Whenever meaningful I will point out those simplifications and discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about TDD in Python read the posts in &lt;a href="/categories/tdd/"&gt;this category&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Project overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the "Rent-o-matic" project (fans of Day of the Tentacle may get the reference) is to create a simple search engine on top of a dataset of objects which are described by some quantities. The search engine shall allow to set some filters to narrow the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects in the dataset are storage rooms for rent described by the following quantities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An unique identifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A size in square meters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A renting price in euros/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latitude and longitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pushed by the clean architecture model, we are interested in separating the different layers of the system. The architecture is described by four layers, which however can be implemented by more than four actual code modules. I will give here a brief description of those layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the level in which the domain models are described. Since we work in Python, I will put here the class that represent my storage rooms, with the data contained in the database, and whichever data I think is useful to perform the core business processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand that the models in this layer are different from the usual models of framework like Django. These models are not connected with a storage system, so they cannot be directly saved or queried using methods of their classes. They may however contain helper methods that implement code related to the business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layer contains the use cases implemented by the system. In this simple example there will be only one use case, which is the list of storage rooms according to the given filters. Here you would put for example a use case that shows the detail of a given storage room or every business process you want to implement, such as booking a storage room, filling it with goods, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interface Adapters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layer corresponds to the boundary between the business logic and external systems and implements the APIs used to exchange data with them. Both the storage system and the user interface are external systems that need to exchange data with the use cases and this layer shall provide an interface for this data flow. In this project the presentation part of this layer is provided by a JSON serializer, on top of which an external web service may be built. The storage adapter shall define here the common API of the storage systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;External interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the architecture is made by external systems that implement the interfaces defined in the previous layer. Here for example you will find a web server that implements (REST) entry points, which access the data provided by use cases through the JSON serializer. You will also find here the storage system implementation, for example a given database such as MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API and shades of grey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word API is of uttermost importance in a clean architecture. Every layer may be accessed by an API, that is a fixed collection of entry points (methods or objects). Here "fixed" means "the same among every implementation", obviously an API may change with time. Every presentation tool, for example, will access the same use cases, and the same methods, to obtain a set of domain models, which are the output of that particular use case. It is up to the presentation layer to format data according to the specific presentation media, for example HTML, PDF, images, etc. If you understand plugin-based architectures you already grasped the main concept of a separate, API-driven component (or layer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same concept is valid for the storage layer. Every storage implementation shall provide the same methods. When dealing with use cases you shall not be concerned with the actual system that stores data, it may be a MongoDB local installation, a cloud storage system or a trivial in-memory dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation between layers, and the content of each layer, is not always fixed and immutable. A well-designed system shall also cope with practical world issues such as performances, for example, or other specific needs. When designing an architecture it is very important to know "what is where and why", and this is even more important when you "bend" the rules. Many issues do not have a black-or-white answer, and many decisions are "shades of grey", that is it is up to you to justify why you put something in a given place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind however, that you should not break the &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; of the clean architecture, in particular you shall be inflexible about the data flow (see the "Crossing boundaries" section in the original post of Robert Martin). If you break the data flow, you are basically invalidating the whole structure. Let me stress it again: &lt;strong&gt;never break the data flow&lt;/strong&gt;. A simple example of breaking the data flow is to let a use case output a Python class instead of a &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; of that class such as a JSON string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Project structure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take a look at the final structure of the project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;structure here&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global structure of the package has been built with Cookiecutter, and I will run quickly through that part. The &lt;code&gt;rentomatic&lt;/code&gt; directory contains the following subdirectories: &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;repositories&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;serializers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;use_cases&lt;/code&gt;. Those directories reflect the layered structure introduced in the previous section, and the structure of the &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; directory mirrors this structure so that tests are easily found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code in &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic"&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to fork it and experiment, change it, and find better solutions to the problem I will discuss in this post. The source code contains tagged commits to allow you to follow the actual development as presented in the post. You can find the current tag in the &lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tag name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; label under the section titles. The label is actually a link to the tagged commit on GitHub, if you want to see the code without cloning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Project initialization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step01"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step01&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Cookiecutter package creates an environment like the one I am creating in this section. I will keep the following explanation so that you can see how to manage requirements and configurations, but for your next project consider using this automated tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually like maintaining a Python virtual environment inside the project, so I will create a temporary virtualenv to install cookiecutter, create the project, and remove the virtualenv. Cookiecutter is going to ask you some questions about you and the project, to provide an initial file structure. We are going to build our own testing environment, so it is safe to answer no to &lt;code&gt;use_pytest&lt;/code&gt;. Since this is a demo project we are not going to need any publishing feature, so you can answer no to &lt;code&gt;use_pypi_deployment_with_travis&lt;/code&gt; as well. The project does not have a command line interface, and you can safely create the author file and use any license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;virtualenv venv3 -p python3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv3/bin/activate
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now answer the questions, then finish creating the project with the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;deactivate
rm -fR venv3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; rentomatic
virtualenv venv3 -p python3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv3/bin/activate
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Get rid of the &lt;code&gt;requirements_dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; file that Cookiecutter created for you. I usually store virtualenv requirements in different hierarchical files to separate production, development and testing environments, so create the &lt;code&gt;requirements&lt;/code&gt; directory and the relative files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mkdir requirements
touch requirements/prod.txt
touch requirements/dev.txt
touch requirements/test.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain specific packages used to test the project. Since to test the project you also need to install the packages for the production environment the file will first include the production one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r prod.txt

pytest
tox
coverage
pytest-cov
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain packages used during the development process and shall install also test and production package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r test.txt

pip
wheel
flake8
Sphinx
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(taking advantage of the fact that &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; already includes &lt;code&gt;prod.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the main &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file of the project will just import &lt;code&gt;requirements/prod.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r prod.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Obviously you are free to find the project structure that better suits your need or preferences. This is the structure we are going to use in this project but nothing forces you to follow it in your personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation allows you to install a full-fledged development environment on your machine, while installing only testing tools in a testing environment like the Travis platform and to further reduce the amount of dependencies in the production case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I am not using version tags in the requirements files. This is because this project is not going to be run in a production environment, so we do not need to freeze the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember at this point to install the development requirements in your virtualenv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; testing library needs to be configured. This is the &lt;code&gt;pytest.ini&lt;/code&gt; file that you can create in the root directory (where the &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; file is located)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[pytest]
minversion = 2.0
norecursedirs = .git .tox venv* requirements*
python_files = test*.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To run the tests during the development of the project just execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ py.test -sv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to check the coverage, i.e. the amount of code which is run by your tests or "covered", execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ py.test --cov-report term-missing --cov&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;rentomatic
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about test coverage check the official documentation of the &lt;a href="http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Coverage.py&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;pytest-cov&lt;/a&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly suggest the use of the &lt;code&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt; package to check that your Python code is PEP8 compliant. This is the &lt;code&gt;flake8&lt;/code&gt; configuration that you can put in your &lt;code&gt;setup.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[flake8]
ignore = D203
exclude = .git, venv*, docs
max-complexity = 10
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To check the compliance of your code with the PEP8 standard execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ flake8
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Flake8 documentation is available &lt;a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that every step in this post produces tested code and a of coverage of 100%. One of the benefits of a clean architecture is the separation between layers, and this guarantees a great degree of testability. Note however that in this tutorial, in particular in the REST sections, some tests have been omitted in favour of a simpler description of the architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Domain models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step02"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step02&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start with a simple definition of the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; model. As said before, the clean architecture models are very lightweight, or at least they are lighter than their counterparts in a framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the TDD methodology the first thing that I write are the tests. Create the &lt;code&gt;tests/domain/test_storageroom.py&lt;/code&gt; and put this code inside it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_model_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.09998975&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_model_from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uuid4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.09998975&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With these two tests we ensure that our model can be initialized with the correct values and that can be created from a dictionary. In this first version all the parameters of the model are required. Later we could want to make some of them optional, and in that case we will have to add the relevant tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's write the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; class in the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/domain/storageroom.py&lt;/code&gt; file. Do not forget to create the &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file in the subdirectories of the project, otherwise Python will not be able to import the modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared.domain_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The model is very simple, and requires no further explanation. One of the benefits of a clean architecture is that each layer contains small pieces of code that, being isolated, shall perform simple tasks. In this case the model provides an initialization API and stores the information inside the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;from_dict&lt;/code&gt; method comes in handy when we have to create a model from data coming from another layer (such as the database layer or the query string of the REST layer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could be tempted to try to simplify the &lt;code&gt;from_dict&lt;/code&gt; function, abstracting it and providing it through a &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; class. Given that a certain level of abstraction and generalization is possible and desirable, the initialization part of the models shall probably deal with various different cases, and thus is better off being implemented directly in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;DomainModel&lt;/code&gt; abstract base class is an easy way to categorize the model for future uses like checking if a class is a model in the system. For more information about this use of Abstract Base Classes in Python see &lt;a href="/blog/2016/04/03/abstract-base-classes-in-python/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Serializers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step03"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step03&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model needs to be serialized if we want to return it as a result of an API call. The typical serialization format is JSON, as this is a broadly accepted standard for web-based API. The serializer is not part of the model, but is an external specialized class that receives the model instance and produces a representation of its structure and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the JSON serialization of our &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; class put in the &lt;code&gt;tests/serializers/test_storageroom_serializer.py&lt;/code&gt; file the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_serializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;srs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_serialize_domain_storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;        {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;quot;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;size&amp;quot;: 200,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;price&amp;quot;: 10,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;longitude&amp;quot;: -0.09998975,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;            &amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot;: 51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;srs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expected_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Put in the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/serializers/storageroom_serializer.py&lt;/code&gt; file the code that makes the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;JSONEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;to_serialize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;longitude&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to_serialize&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Providing a class that inherits from &lt;code&gt;json.JSONEncoder&lt;/code&gt; let us use the &lt;code&gt;json.dumps(room, cls=StorageRoomEncoder)&lt;/code&gt; syntax to serialize the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain degree of repetition in the code we wrote, and this is the annoying part of a clean architecture. Since we want to isolate layers as much as possible and create lightweight classes we end up somehow repeating certain types of actions. For example the serialization code that assigns attributes of a &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; to JSON attributes is very similar to that we use to create the object from a dictionary. Not exactly the same, obviously, but the two functions are very close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Use cases (part 1)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step04"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step04&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to implement the actual business logic our application wants to expose to the outside world. Use cases are the place where we implement classes that query the repository, apply business rules, logic, and whatever transformation we need for our data, and return the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those requirements in mind, let us start to build a use case step by step. The simplest use case we can create is one that fetches all the storage rooms from the repository and returns them. Please note that we did not implement any repository layer yet, so our tests will mock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the skeleton for a basic test of a use case that lists all the storage rooms. Put this code in the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;913694c6-435a-4366-ba0d-da5334a611b2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.45994069&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.33894476&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.39916678&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The test is straightforward. First we mock the repository so that is provides a &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method that returns the list of models we created above the test. Then we initialize the use case with the repo and execute it, collecting the result. The first thing we check is if the repository method was called without any parameter, and the second is the effective correctness of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the implementation of the use case that makes the test pass. Put the code in the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/storageroom_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With such an implementation of the use case, however, we will soon experience issues. For starters, we do not have a standard way to transport the call parameters, which means that we do not have a standard way to check for their correctness either. The second problem is that we miss a standard way to return the call results and consequently we lack a way to communicate if the call was successful of if it failed, and in the latter case what are the reasons of the failure. This applies also to the case of bad parameters discussed in the previous point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want thus to introduce some structures to wrap input and outputs of our use cases. Those structures are called request and response objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Requests and responses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step05"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step05&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Request and response objects are an important part of a clean architecture, as they transport call parameters, inputs and results from outside the application into the use cases layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, requests are objects created from incoming API calls, thus they shall deal with things like incorrect values, missing parameters, wrong formats, etc. Responses, on the other hand, have to contain the actual results of the API calls, but shall also be able to represent error cases and to deliver rich information on what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual implementation of request and response objects is completely free, the clean architecture says nothing about them. The decision on how to pack and represent data is up to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment we just need a &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; that can be initialized without parameters, so let us create the file &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; and put there a test for this object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_storageroom_list_request_object_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_file_list_request_object_from_empty_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While at the moment this request object is basically empty, it will come in handy as soon as we start having parameters for the list use case. The code of the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; is the following and goes into the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The response object is also very simple, since for the moment we just need a successful response. Unlike the request, the response is not linked to any particular use case, so the test file can be named &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_success_is_true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the actual response object is in the file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/response_object.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Use cases (part 2)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step06"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step06&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have implemented the request and response object we can change the test code to include those structures. Change the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; to contain this code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;215&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The new version of the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_case/storageroom_use_cases.py&lt;/code&gt; file is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let us consider what we have achieved with our clean architecture up to this point. We have a very lightweight model that can be serialized to JSON and which is completely independent from other parts of the system. The code also contains a use case that, given a repository that exposes a given API, extracts all the models and returns them contained in a structured object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are missing some objects, however. For example, we have not implemented any unsuccessful response object or validated the incoming request object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore these missing parts of the architecture let us improve the current use case to accept a &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter that represents some filters that we want to apply to the extracted list of models. This will generate some possible error conditions for the input, forcing us to introduce some validation for the incoming request object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Requests and validation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step07"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step07&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to add a &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the request. Through that parameter the caller can add different filters by specifying a name and a value for each filter (for instance &lt;code&gt;{'price_lt': 100}&lt;/code&gt; to get all results with a price lesser than 100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to change the request object, starting from the test. The new version of the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; file is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_storageroom_list_request_object_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_build_storageroom_list_request_object_from_dict_with_invalid_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;has_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see I added the &lt;code&gt;assert req.filters is None&lt;/code&gt; check to the original two tests, then I added 5 tests to check if filters can be specified and to test the behaviour of the object with an invalid filter parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the tests pass we have to change our &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; class. There are obviously multiple possible solutions that you can come up with, and I recommend you to try to find your own. This is the one I usually employ. The file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/request_object.py&lt;/code&gt; becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;has_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Is not iterable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;has_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_req&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me review this new code bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, two helper objects have been introduced, &lt;code&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt;. They are different because an invalid request shall contain the validation errors, but both can be converted to booleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; accepts an optional &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter when instantiated. There are no validation checks in the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method because this is considered to be an internal method that gets called when the parameters have already been validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the &lt;code&gt;from_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method performs the validation of the &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter, if it is present. I leverage the &lt;code&gt;collections.Mapping&lt;/code&gt; abstract base class to check if the incoming parameter is a dictionary-like object and return either an &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we can now tell bad requests from good ones we need to introduce a new type of response as well, to manage bad requests or other errors in the use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Responses and failures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step08"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step08&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if the use case encounter an error? Use cases can encounter a wide set of errors: validation errors, as we just discussed in the previous section, but also business logic errors or errors that come from the repository layer. Whatever the error, the use case shall always return an object with a known structure (the response), so we need a new object that provides a good support for different types of failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As happened for the requests there is no unique way to provide such an object, and the following code is just one of the possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to expand the &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; file, adding tests for failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ResponseError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;This is a response error&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is some boilerplate code, basically pytest fixtures that we will use in the following tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_success_is_true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_is_false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two basic tests to check that both the old &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; and the new &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; objects behave consistently when converted to boolean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_success_contains_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; object contains the call result in the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_has_type_and_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_contains_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These two tests ensure that the &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; object provides the same interface provided by the successful one and that the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; parameter are accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_initialization_with_exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Just an error message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_type&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Exception: Just an error message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_from_invalid_request_object_with_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Is mandatory&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t be blank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;path: Is mandatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path: can&amp;#39;t be blank&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We sometimes want to create responses from Python exceptions that can happen in the use case, so we test that &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; objects can be initialized with a generic exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last we have the tests for the &lt;code&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object()&lt;/code&gt; method that automate the initialization of the response from an invalid request. If the request contains errors (remember that the request validates itself), we need to put them into the response message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last test uses a class attribute to classify the error. The &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; class will contain three predefined errors that can happen when running the use case, namely &lt;code&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;. This categorization is an attempt to capture the different types of issues that can happen when dealing with an external system through an API. &lt;code&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; contains all those errors that are related to the resources contained in the repository, for instance when you cannot find an entry given its unique id. &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; describes all those errors that occur when the request parameters are wrong or missing. &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; encompass the errors that happen in the underlying system at operating system level, such as a failure in a filesystem operation, or a network connection error while fetching data from the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case has the responsibility to manage the different error conditions arising from the Python code and to convert them into an error description made of one of the three types I just described and a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's write the &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; class that makes the tests pass. This can be the initial definition of the class. Put it in &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/response_object.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ResourceError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ParametersError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SystemError&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;type_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;type_&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_format_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_format_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Through the &lt;code&gt;_format_message()&lt;/code&gt; method we enable the class to accept both string messages and Python exceptions, which is very handy when dealing with external libraries that can raise exceptions we do not know or do not want to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This property makes the class comply with the &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; API, providing the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which is an aptly formatted dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
                             &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As explained before, the &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; type encompasses all those errors that come from an invalid set of parameters, which is the case of this function, that shall be called whenever the request is wrong, which means that some parameters contain errors or are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since building failure responses is a common activity it is useful to have helper methods, so I add three tests for the building functions to the &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_build_resource_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_resource_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_response_failure_build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We add the relevant methods to the class and change the &lt;code&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object()&lt;/code&gt; method to leverage the &lt;code&gt;build_parameters_error()&lt;/code&gt; new method. Change the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; file to contain this code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_resource_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;parameter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
                             &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_parameters_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Use cases (part 3)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step09"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step09&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our implementation of responses and requests is finally complete, so now we can implement the last version of our use case. The use case correctly returns a &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; object but is still missing a proper validation of the incoming request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's change the test in the &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; file and add two more tests. The resulting set of tests (after the &lt;code&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/code&gt; fixture) is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain.storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the test we already wrote, but the &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method is called with &lt;code&gt;filters=None&lt;/code&gt; to reflect the added parameter. The import line has slightly changed as well, given that we are now importing both &lt;code&gt;response_objects&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;request_objects&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/code&gt; fixture has not changed and has been omitted from the code snippet to keep it short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_with_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;qry_filters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;qry_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;qry_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test checks that the value of the &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; key in the dictionary used to create the request is actually used when calling the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_handles_generic_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Just an error message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_storageroom_list_handles_bad_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_list_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;filters: Is not iterable&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This last two tests check the behaviour of the use case when the repository raises an exception or when the request is badly formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/storageroom_use_cases.py&lt;/code&gt; to contain the new use case implementation that makes all the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storage_rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the first thing that the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method does is to check if the request is valid, otherwise returns a &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt; build with the same request object. Then the actual business logic is implemented, calling the repository and returning a success response. If something goes wrong in this phase the exception is caught and returned as an aptly formatted &lt;code&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Intermezzo: refactoring&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step10"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clean architecture is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a framework, so it provides very few generic features, unlike products like for example Django, which provide models, ORM, and all sorts of structures and libraries. Nevertheless, some classes can be isolated from our code and provided as a library, so that we can reuse the code. In this section I will guide you through a refactoring of the code we already have, during which we will isolate common features for requests, responses, and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already isolated the response object. We can move the &lt;code&gt;test_valid_request_object_cannot_be_used&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;tests/use_cases/test_storageroom_list_request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_response_object.py&lt;/code&gt; since it tests a generic behaviour and not something related to the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/code&gt; model and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can move the &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ValidRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; classes from &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/request_objects.py&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/request_object.py&lt;/code&gt;, making the necessary changes to the &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; class that now inherits from an external class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case is the class that undergoes the major changes. The &lt;code&gt;UseCase&lt;/code&gt; class is tested by the following code in the &lt;code&gt;tests/shared/test_use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_use_case_cannot_process_valid_requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MagicMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__bool__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; \
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;NotImplementedError: process_request() not implemented by UseCase class&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test checks that the &lt;code&gt;UseCase&lt;/code&gt; class cannot be actually used to process incoming requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_use_case_can_process_invalid_requests_and_returns_response_failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;someparam&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;someparam: somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test runs the use case with an invalid request and check if the response is correct. Since the request is wrong the response type is &lt;code&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, as this represents an issue in the request parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_use_case_can_manage_generic_exception_from_process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TestException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TestException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;TestException: somemessage&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This test makes the use case raise an exception. This type of error is categorized as &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, which is a generic name for an exception which is not related to request parameters or actual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this last test the idea is that of exposing the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;code&gt;UseCase&lt;/code&gt; class and to call the &lt;code&gt;process_request()&lt;/code&gt; method defined by each child class, which is the actual use case we are implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/shared/use_case.py&lt;/code&gt; file contains the following code that makes the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_from_invalid_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}: {}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;process_request() not implemented by UseCase class&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/use_cases/storageroom_use_cases.py&lt;/code&gt; now contains the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;process_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;The repository layer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step11"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository layer is the one in which we run the data storage system. As you saw when we implemented the use case we access the data storage through an API, in this case the &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method of the repository. The level of abstraction provided by a repository level is higher than that provided by an ORM or by a tool like SQLAlchemy. The repository layer provides only the endpoints that the application needs, with an interface which is tailored on the specific business problems the application implements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify the matter in terms of concrete technologies, SQLAlchemy is a wonderful tool to abstract the access to an SQL database, so the internal implementation of the repository layer could use it to access a PostgreSQL database. But the external API of the layer is not that provided by SQLAlchemy. The API is a (usually reduced) set of functions that the use cases call to get the data, and indeed the internal implementation could also use raw SQL queries on a proprietary network interface. The repository does not even need to be based on a database. We can have a repository layer that fetches data from a REST service, for example, or that makes remote procedure calls through a RabbitMQ network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important feature of the repository layer is that it always returns domain models, and this is in line with what framework ORMs usually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not deploy a real database in this post. I will address that part of the application in a future post, where there will be enough space to implement two different solutions and show how the repository API can mask the actual implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I am going to create a very simple memory storage system with some predefined data. I think this is enough for the moment to demonstrate the repository concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to write some tests that document the public API of the repository. The file containing the tests is &lt;code&gt;tests/repository/test_memrepo.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we add some data that we will be using in the tests. We import the domain model to check if the results of the API calls have the correct type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared.domain_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;fe2c3195-aeff-487a-a08f-e0bdc0ec6e9a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since the repository object will return domain models, we need a helper function to check the correctness of the results. The following function checks the length of the two lists, ensures that all the returned elements are domain models and compares the codes. Note that we can safely employ the &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function since &lt;code&gt;DomainModel&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract base class and our models are registered (see the &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/domain/storagerooms.py&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DomainModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_models_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to initialize the repository with a list of dictionaries, and the &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method without any parameter shall return the same list of entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_without_parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; method shall accept a &lt;code&gt;filters&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which is a dictionary. The dictionary keys shall be in the form &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;attribute&amp;gt;__&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, similar to the syntax used by the Django ORM. So to express that the price shall be less than 65 we can write &lt;code&gt;filters={'price__lt': 60}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of error conditions shall be checked: using an unknown key shall raise a &lt;code&gt;KeyError&lt;/code&gt; exception, and using a wrong operator shall raise a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt; exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_unknown_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;aname&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_unknown_operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__in&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let us then test that the filtering mechanism actually works. We want the default operator to be &lt;code&gt;__eq&lt;/code&gt;, which means that if we do not put any operator an equality check shall be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__lt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price__gt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size__eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size__lt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size__gt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_repository_list_with_filters_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_check_results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;913694c6-435a-4366-ba0d-da5334a611b2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the &lt;code&gt;MemRepo&lt;/code&gt; class is pretty simple, and I will not dive into it line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;eq&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;lt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Operator {} is not supported&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__{}__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;The REST layer (part1)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step12"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last step of our journey into the clean architecture. We created the domain models, the serializers, the use cases and the repository. We are actually missing an interface that glues everything together, that is gets the call parameters from the user, initializes a use case with a repository, runs the use case that fetches the domain models from the repository and converts them to a standard format. This layer can be represented by a wide number of interfaces and technologies. For example a command line interface (CLI) can implement exactly those steps, getting the parameters via command line switches, and returning the results as plain text on the console. The same underlying system, however, can be leveraged by a web page that gets the call parameters from a set of widgets, perform the steps described above, and parses the returned JSON data to show the result on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever technology we want to use to interact with the user to collect inputs and provide results we need to interface with the clean architecture we just built, so now we will create a layer to expose an HTTP API. This can be done with a server that exposes a set of HTTP addresses (API endpoints) that once accessed return some data. Such a layer is commonly called a REST layer, because usually the semantic of the addresses comes from the REST recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask is a lightweight web server with a modular structure that provides just the parts that the user needs. In particular, we will not use any database/ORM, since we already implemented our own repository layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this part of the project, together with the repository layer, is usually implemented as a separate package, and I am keeping them together just for the sake of this introductory tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start updating the requirements files. The &lt;code&gt;prod.txt&lt;/code&gt; file shall contain Flask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Flask
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain the &lt;a href="https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Flask-Script extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r test.txt

pip
wheel
flake8
Sphinx
Flask-Script
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file will contain the pytest extension to work with Flask (more on this later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-r prod.txt

pytest
tox
coverage
pytest-cov
pytest-flask
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember to run &lt;code&gt;pip install -r requirements/dev.txt&lt;/code&gt; again after those changes to actually install the new packages in your virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup of a Flask application is not complex, but a lot of concepts are involved, and since this is not a tutorial on Flask I will run quickly through these steps. I will however provide links to the Flask documentation for every concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually define different configurations for my testing, development, and production environments. Since the Flask application can be configured using a plain Python object (&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/api/#flask.Config.from_object"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;), I create the file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/settings.py&lt;/code&gt; to host those objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Base configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;APP_DIR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__file__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This directory&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;PROJECT_ROOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;APP_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pardir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProdConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Production configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;prod&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;DevConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Development configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;dev&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TestConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Test configuration.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;test&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;TESTING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/config/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to know more about Flask configuration parameters. Now we need a function that initializes the Flask application (&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/patterns/appfactories/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;), configures it and registers the blueprints (&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/blueprints/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;). The file &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/app.py&lt;/code&gt; contains the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.rest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DevConfig&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DevConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register_blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The application endpoints need to return a Flask &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; object, with the actual results and an HTTP status. The content of the response, in this case, is the JSON serialization of the use case response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us write a test step by step, so that you can perfectly understand what is going to happen in the REST endpoint. The basic structure of the test is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[SOME PREPARATION]
[CALL THE API ENDPOINT]
[CHECK RESPONSE DATA]
[CHECK RESPONDSE STATUS CODE]
[CHECK RESPONSE MIMETYPE]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So our first test &lt;code&gt;tests/rest/test_get_storagerooms_list.py&lt;/code&gt; is made of the following parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember that we are not testing the use case here, so we can safely mock it. Here we make the use case return a &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; instance containing a list of domain models (that we didn't define yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the actual API call. We are exposing the endpoint at the &lt;code&gt;/storagerooms&lt;/code&gt; address. Note the use of the &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; fixture provided by &lt;code&gt;pytest-flask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are the three checks previously mentioned. The second and the third ones are pretty straightforward, while the first one needs some explanations. We want to compare &lt;code&gt;http_response.data&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[storageroom1_dict]&lt;/code&gt;, which is a list with a Python dictionary containing the data of the &lt;code&gt;storageroom1_domain_model&lt;/code&gt; object. Flask &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; objects contain a binary representation of the data, so first we decode the bytes using UTF-8, then convert them in a Python object. It is much more convenient to compare Python objects, since pytest can deal with issues like the unordered nature of dictionaries, while this is not possible when comparing two strings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final test file, with the test domain model and its dictionary is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.domain.storageroom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;3251a5bd-86be-428d-8ae9-6e51a8048c33&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.09998975&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;51.75436293&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_domain_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_domain_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storagerooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's time to write the endpoint, where we will finally see all the pieces of the architecture working together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimal Flask endpoint we can put in &lt;code&gt;rentomatic/rest/storageroom.py&lt;/code&gt; is something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;storageroom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@blueprint.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LOGIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first part of our logic is the creation of a &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt;. For the moment we can ignore the optional querystring parameters and use an empty dictionary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see I'm creating the object from an empty dictionary, so querystring parameters are not taken into account for the moment. The second thing to do is to initialize the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third thing the endpoint has to do is the initialization of the use case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally we run the use case passing the request object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This response, however, is not yet an HTTP response, and we have to explicitly build it. The HTTP response will contain the JSON representation of the &lt;code&gt;response.value&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that this function is obviously still incomplete, as it returns always a successful response (code 200). It is however enough to pass the test we wrote. The whole file is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_serializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;storageroom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@blueprint.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;storageroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This code demonstrates how the clean architecture works in a nutshell. The function we wrote is however not complete, as it doesn't consider querystring parameters and error cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The server in action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step13"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I fix the missing parts of the endpoint let us see the server in action, so we can finally enjoy the product we have been building during this long post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To actually see some results when accessing the endpoint we need to fill the repository with some data. This part is obviously required only because of the ephemeral nature of the repository we are using. A real repository would wrap a persistent source of data and providing data at this point wouldn't be necessary. To initialize the repository we have to define some data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;f853578c-fc0f-4e65-81b8-566c5dffa35a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;215&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-0.09998975&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.75436293&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;fe2c3195-aeff-487a-a08f-e0bdc0ec6e9a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.18228006&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.74640997&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;913694c6-435a-4366-ba0d-da5334a611b2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;longitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0.27891577&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;latitude&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;51.45994069&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And them feed them into the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we can run the Flask &lt;code&gt;manage.py&lt;/code&gt; file to check the exposed URLs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python manage.py urls
Rule                     Endpoint               
------------------------------------------------
/static/&amp;lt;path:filename&amp;gt;  static                 
/storagerooms            storageroom.storageroom
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and run the development server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python manage.py server
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you open your browser and navigate to &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/storagerooms"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5000/storagerooms&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the API call results. I recommend installing a formatter extension for the browser to better check the output. If you are using Chrome try &lt;a href="https://github.com/callumlocke/json-formatter"&gt;JSON Formatter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The REST layer (part2)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git tag: &lt;a href="https://github.com/lgiordani/rentomatic/tree/step14"&gt;&lt;code&gt;step14&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us cover the two missing cases in the endpoint. First I introduce a test to check if the endpoint correctly handles querystring parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_failed_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_system_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;test message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UTF-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;SYSTEM_ERROR&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                                              &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;test message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This makes the use case return a failed response and check that the HTTP response contains a formatted version of the error. To make this test pass we have to introduce a proper mapping between domain responses codes and HTTP codes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS_CODES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RESOURCE_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PARAMETERS_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SYSTEM_ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we need to create the Flask response with the correct code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS_CODES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second and last test is a bit more complex. As before we will mock the use case, but this time we will also patch &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt;. We need in fact to know if the request object is initialized with the correct parameters from the command line. So, step by step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@mock.patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.storageroom_use_cases.StorageRoomListUseCase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_request_object_initialisation_and_use_with_filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, like, beforse, a patch of the use case class that ensures the use case will return a &lt;code&gt;ResponseSuccess&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The request object will be internally created with &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject.from_dict&lt;/code&gt;, and we want that function to return a known mock object, which is the one we initialized here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;rentomatic.use_cases.request_objects.StorageRoomListRequestObject&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/storagerooms?filter_param1=value1&amp;amp;filter_param2=value2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we patch &lt;code&gt;StorageRoomListRequestObject&lt;/code&gt; and we assign a known output to the &lt;code&gt;from_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method. Then we call the endpoint with some querystring parameters. What should happen is that the &lt;code&gt;from_dict()&lt;/code&gt; method of the request is called with the filter parameters and that the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method of the use case instance is called with the &lt;code&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;filters&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;param1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;param2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;value2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;internal_request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The endpoint function shall be changed somehow to reflect this new behaviour and to make the test pass. The whole code of the new &lt;code&gt;storageroom()&lt;/code&gt; Flask method is the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request_objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;memrepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_use_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rentomatic.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;storageroom_serializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomListUseCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;use_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dumps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StorageRoomEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATUS_CODES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that we extract the querystring parameters from the global &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object provided by Flask. Once the querystring parameters are in a dictionary, we just need to create the request object from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's all! Some tests are missing in the REST part, but as I said I just wanted to show a working implementation of a clean architecture and not a fully developed project. I suggest that you try to implement some changes, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another endpoint like the access to a single resource (&lt;code&gt;/storagerooms/&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a different repository, connected to a real DB (you can use &lt;a href="https://sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;, for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement a new querystring parameter, for example the distance from a given point on the map (use &lt;a href="https://github.com/geopy/geopy"&gt;geopy&lt;/a&gt; to easily compute distances)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you develop your code always try to work following the TDD approach. Testability is one of the main features of a clean architecture, so don't ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you decide to use a clean architecture or not, I really hope this post helped you to get a fresh view on software architectures, as happened to me when I first discovered the concepts exemplified here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016-11-15: Two tests contained variables with a wrong name (artist), which came from an initial version of the project. The name did not affect the tests. Added some instructions on the virtual environment and the development requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016-12-12: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Taifu"&gt;Marco Beri&lt;/a&gt; who spotted a typo in the code of step 6, which was already correct in the GitHub repository. He also suggested using the Cookiecutter package by &lt;a href="https://github.com/ardydedase"&gt;Ardy Dedase&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Marco and to Ardy!&lt;/p&gt;

I described the basic behaviour of mock objects, the &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt; attributes, and the &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will briefly review the remaining &lt;code&gt;assert_*&lt;/code&gt; methods and some interesting attributes that allow to check the calls received by the mock object. Then I will introduce and exemplify patching, which is a very important topic in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other assertions and attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; of the mock library lists many other assertion, namely &lt;code&gt;assert_called_once_with()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_any_call()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_has_calls()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_not_called()&lt;/code&gt;. If you grasped how &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; works, you will have no troubles in understanding how those other behave. Be sure to check the documentation to get a full description of what mock object can assert about their history after being used by your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with those methods, mock objects also provide some useful attributes, two of which have been already reviewed in the first post. The remaining attributes are as expected mostly related to calls, and are &lt;code&gt;called&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_count&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_args&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_args_list&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;method_calls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mock_calls&lt;/code&gt;. While these also are very well descripted in the official documentation, I want to point out the two &lt;code&gt;method_calls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mock_calls&lt;/code&gt; attributes, that store the detailed list of methods which are called on the mock, and the &lt;code&gt;call_args_list&lt;/code&gt; attribute that lists the parameters of every call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not forget that methods called on a mock object are mocks themselves, so you may first access the main mock object to get information about the called methods, and then access those methods to get the arguments they received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocks are very simple to introduce in your tests whenever your objects accept classes or instances from outside. In that case, as described, you just have to instantiate the &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; class and pass the resulting object to your system. However, when the external classes instantiated by your library are hardcoded this simple trick does not work. In this case you have no chance to pass a mock object instead of the real one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the case addressed by patching. Patching, in a testing framework, means to replace a globally reachable object with a mock, thus achieving the target of having the code run unmodified, while part of it has been hot swapped, that is, replaced at run time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A warm-up example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start with a very simple example. Patching can be complex to grasp at the beginning so it is better to learn it with trivial code. If you do not have it yet, create the testing environment &lt;code&gt;mockplayground&lt;/code&gt; with the instruction given in the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to develop a simple class that returns information about a given file. The class shall be instantiated with the filename, which can be a relative path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of brevity I will not show you every step of the TDD development of the class. Remember that TDD requires you to write a test and then implement the code, but sometimes this could be too fine grained, so do not use the TDD rules without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests for the initialization of the class are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;fileinfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;relative_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;relative_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can put them into the &lt;code&gt;tests/test_fileinfo.py&lt;/code&gt; file. The code that makes the tests pass could be something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;basename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Up to now I didn't introduce any new feature. Now I want the &lt;code&gt;get_info()&lt;/code&gt; function to return a tuple with the file name, the original path the class was instantiated with, and the absolute path of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You immediately realise that you have an issue in writing the test. There is no way to easily test something as "the absolute path", since the outcome of the function called in the test is supposed to vary with the path of the test itself. Let us write part of the test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;???&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where the '???' string highlights that I cannot put something sensible to test the absolute path of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching is the way to solve this problem. You know that the function will use some code to get the absolute path of the file. So in the scope of the test only you can replace that code with different code and perform the test. Since the replacement code has a known outcome writing the test is now possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching, thus, means to inform Python that in some scope you want a globally accessible module/object replaced by a mock. Let's see how we can use it in our example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest.mock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember that if you are using Python 2 you installed the &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; module with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;, so your import statement becomes &lt;code&gt;form mock import patch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You clearly see the context in which the patching happens, as it is enclosed in a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement. Inside this statement the module &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced by a mock created by the function &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; and called &lt;code&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/code&gt;. We can now give the function a &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; as we did with standard mocks in the first post and run the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that make the test pass is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Obviously to write the test you have to know that you are going to use the &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt; function, so patching is somehow a "less pure" practice in TDD. In pure OOP/TDD you are only concerned with the external behaviour of the object, and not with its internal structure. This example, however, shows that you have to cope with some real world issues, and patching is a clean way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The patching decorator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; function we imported from the &lt;code&gt;unittest.mock&lt;/code&gt; module is very powerful, and can be used as a function decorator as well. When used in this fashion you need to change the decorated function to accept a mock as last argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; decorator works like a big &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement for the whole function. Obviously in this way you replace the target function &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt; in the scope of the whole function. It is then up to you to decide if you need to use &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; as a decorator or in a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Multiple patches&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also patch more that one object. Say for example that we want to change the above test to check that the outcome of the &lt;code&gt;FileInfo.get_info()&lt;/code&gt; method also contains the size of the file. To get the size of a file in Python we may use the &lt;code&gt;os.path.getsize()&lt;/code&gt; function, which returns the size of the file in bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have to patch &lt;code&gt;os.path.getsize&lt;/code&gt; as well, and this can be done with another &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; decorator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.getsize&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please notice that the decorator which is nearest to the function is applied first. Always remember that the decorator syntax with &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut to replace the function with the output of the decorator, so two decorators result in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@decorator1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@decorator2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which is a shorcut for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;decorator1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decorator2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This explains why, in the test code, the function receives first &lt;code&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/code&gt;. The first decorator applied to the function is the patch of &lt;code&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/code&gt;, which appends the mock that we call &lt;code&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/code&gt;. Then the patch of &lt;code&gt;os.path.getsize&lt;/code&gt; is applied and this appends its own mock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that makes the test pass is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can write the above test using two &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statements as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;somefile.ext&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.abspath&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some/abs/path&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;os.path.getsize&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;getsize_mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using more than one &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement, however, makes the code difficult to read, in my opinion, so in general I prefer to avoid complex &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; trees if I do not need a limited scope of the patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Patching immutable objects&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widespread version of Python is CPython, which is written, as the name suggests, in C. Part of the standard library is also written in C, while the rest is written in Python itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objects (classes, modules, functions, etc) that are implemented in C are shared between interpreters, which is something that you can do embedding the Python interpreter in a C program, for example. This requires those objects to be immutable, so that you cannot alter them at runtime from a single interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of this immutability just check the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conjugate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;#39;int&amp;#39; object attribute &amp;#39;conjugate&amp;#39; is read-only&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I'm trying to replace a method with an integer, which is pointless, but nevertheless shows the issue we are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has this immutability to do with patching? What &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; does is actually to temporarily replace an attibute of an object (method of a class, class of a module, etc), so if that object is immutable the patching action fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical example of this problem is the &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; module, which is also one of the best candidates for patching, since the output of time functions is by definition time-varying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show the problem with a simple class that logs operations. The class is the following (you can put it into a file called &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is pretty simple, but testing this code is problematic, because the &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt; method produces results that depend on the actual execution time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we try to write a test patching &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt; we have a bitter surprise. This is the test code, that you can put in &lt;code&gt;tests/test_logger.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest.mock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;datetime.datetime.now&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;A test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the execution of pytest returns a &lt;code&gt;TypeError: can't set attributes of built-in/extension type 'datetime.datetime'&lt;/code&gt;, which is exactly a problem of immutability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to address this problem, but all of them leverage the fact that, when you import of subclass an immutable object what you get is a "copy" of that is now mutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest example in this case is the module &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; itself. In the &lt;code&gt;test_log&lt;/code&gt; function we try to patch directly the &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt; object, affecting the builtin module &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;. The file &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt;, however, does import &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;, so that this latter becomes a local symbol in the &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; module. This is exactly the key for our patching. Let us change the code to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;logger.datetime.datetime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;A test message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you see running the test now the patching works. What we did was to patch &lt;code&gt;logger.datetime.datetime&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt;. Two things changed, thus, in our test. First, we are patching the module imported in the &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt; file and not the module provided globally by the Python interpreter. Second, we have to patch the whole module because this is what is imported by the &lt;code&gt;logger.py&lt;/code&gt; file. If you try to patch &lt;code&gt;logger.datetime.datetime.now&lt;/code&gt; you will find that it is still immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible solution to this problem is to create a function that invokes the immutable object and returns its value. This last function can be easily patched, because it just uses the builtin objects and thus is not immutable. This solution, however, requires to change the source code to allow testing, which is far from being desirable. Obviously it is better to introduce a small change in the code and have it tested than to leave it untested, but whenever is possible I avoid solutions that introduce code which wouldn't be required without tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second part of this small series on Python testing we reviewd the patching mechanism and run through some of its subleties. Patching is a really effective technique, and patch-based tests can be found in many different packages. Take your time to become confident with mocks and patching, since they will be one of your main tools while working with Python and any other object-oriented language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I strongly recommend finding some time to read the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; of the mock library.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that you need to isolate a given (external) function that is part of your public API and demonstrate that it works with standard inputs and in edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are going to develop an object that stores percentages (such as for example poll results), you should test the following conditions: the class can store a standard percentage such as 42%, the class shall give an error if you try to store a negative percentage, the class shall give an error if you store a percentage greater than 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests shall be &lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;isolated&lt;/em&gt;. Idempotent in mathematics and computer science identifies a process that can be run multiple times without changing the status of the system. Isolated means that a test shall not change its behaviour depending on previous executions of itself, nor depend on the previous execution (or missing execution) of other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such restrictions, which guarantee that your tests are not passing due to a temporary configuration of the system or the order in which they are run, can raise big issues when dealing with external libraries and systems, or with intrinsically mutable concepts such as time. In the testing discipline, such issues are mostly faced using mocks, that is objects that pretend to be other objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts I am going to review the Python &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; library and exemplify its use. I will not cover everything you may do with mock, obviously, but hopefully I'll give you the information you need to start using this powerful library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;code&gt;mock&lt;/code&gt; is a Python library which development started around 2008. It was selected to be included in the standard library as of Python 3.3, which however does not prevent you to use other libraries if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3 users, thus, are not required to take any step, while for Python 2 projects you are still required to issue a &lt;code&gt;pip install mock&lt;/code&gt; to install it into the system or the current virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find the official documentation &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is very detailed, and as always I strongly recommend taking your time to run through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mock, in the testing lingo, is an object that simulates the behaviour of another (more complex) object. When you (unit)test an object of your library you need sometimes to access other systems your object want to connect to, but you do not really want to be forced to run them, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is that connecting with external systems means having a complex testing environment, that is you are dropping the isolation requirement of you tests. If your object wants to connect with a website, for example, you are forced to have a running Internet connection, and if the remote website is down you cannot test your library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that the setup of an external system is usually slow in comparison with the speed of unit tests. We expect to run hundred of tests in seconds, and if we have to fetch information from a remote server for each of them the time easily increases by several orders of magnitude. Remember: having slow tests means that you cannot run them while you develop, which in turn means that you will not really use them for TDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third reason is more subtle, and has to to with the mutable nature of an external system, thus I'll postpone the discussion of this issue for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us try and work with a mock in Python and see what it can do. First of all fire up a Python shell or a &lt;a href="http://jupyter.org"&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt; and import the library &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are using Python 2 you have to install it and use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main object that the library provides is &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; and you can instantiate it without any argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This object has the peculiar property of creating methods and attributes on the fly when you require them. Let us first look inside the object to take a glance of what it provides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;#39;assert_any_call&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_once_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_has_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;attach_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args_list&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_count&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;called&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;configure_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;method_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_add_spec&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;reset_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;return_value&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;side_effect&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are some methods which are already defined into the &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; object. Let us read a non-existent attribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;Mock name=&amp;#39;mock.some_attribute&amp;#39; id=&amp;#39;140222043808432&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;#39;assert_any_call&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_once_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_called_with&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;assert_has_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;attach_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_args_list&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;call_count&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;called&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;configure_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;method_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_add_spec&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mock_calls&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;reset_mock&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;return_value&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;side_effect&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;some_attribute&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, as you can see this class is somehow different from what you are accustomed to. First of all its instances do not raise an &lt;code&gt;AttributeError&lt;/code&gt; when asked for a non-existent attribute, but they happily return another instance of &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; itself. Second, the attribute you tried to access has now been created inside the object and accessing it returns the same mock object as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;Mock name=&amp;#39;mock.some_attribute&amp;#39; id=&amp;#39;140222043808432&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mock objects are callables, which means that they may act both as attributes and as methods. If you try to call the mock it just returns you another mock with a name that includes parentheses to signal its callable nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;Mock name=&amp;#39;mock.some_attribute()&amp;#39; id=&amp;#39;140247621475856&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can understand, such objects are the perfect tool to mimic other objects or systems, since they may expose any API without raising exceptions. To use them in tests, however, we need them to behave just like the original, which implies returning sensible values or performing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Return value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest thing a mock can do for you is to return a given value every time you call it. This is configured setting the &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; attribute of a mock object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now the object does not return a mock object any more, instead it just returns the static value stored in the &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Obviously you can also store a callable such as a function or an object, and the method will return it, but it will not run it. Let me give you an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;42&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;function print_answer at 0x7f8df1e3f400&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see calling &lt;code&gt;some_attribute()&lt;/code&gt; just returns the value stored in &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt;, that is the function itself. To return values that come from a function we have to use a slightly more complex attribute of mock objects called &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt; parameter of mock objects is a very powerful tool. It accepts three different flavours of objects, callables, iterables, and exceptions, and changes its behaviour accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pass an exception the mock will raise it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;A custom value error&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;902&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;958&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;A custom value error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you pass an iterable, such as for example a generator, or a plain list, tuple, or similar objects, the mock will yield the values of that iterable, i.e. return every value contained in the iterable on subsequent calls of the mock. Let me give you an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;902&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;__call__&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;961&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;_mock_call&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;StopIteration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As promised, the mock just returns every object found in the iterable (in this case a &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; object) once at a time until the generator is exhausted. According to the iterator protocol (see &lt;a href="/blog/2013/03/25/python-generators-from-iterators-to-cooperative-multitasking/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) once every item has been returned the object raises the &lt;code&gt;StopIteration&lt;/code&gt; exception, which means that you can correctly use it in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last and perhaps most used case is that of passing a callable to &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt;, which shamelessly executes it with its own same parameters. This is very powerful, especially if you stop thinking about "functions" and start considering "callables". Indeed, &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt; also accepts a class and calls it, that is it can instantiate objects. Let us consider a simple example with a function without arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;42&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;       
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print_answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A slightly more complex example: a function with arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Number:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print_number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Number: 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally an example with a class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Value:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Value: 26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Testing with mocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know how to build a mock and how to give it a static return value or make it call a callable object. It is time to see how to use a mock in a test and what facilities do mocks provide. I'm going to use &lt;a href="http://pytest.org"&gt;pytest&lt;/a&gt; as a testing framework. You can find a quick introduction to pytest and TDD &lt;a href="/categories/tdd/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to quickly setup a pytest playground you may execute this code in a terminal (you need to have Python 3 and virtualenv installed in your system) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mkdir mockplayground
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; mockplayground
virtualenv venv3 -p python3
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv3/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pytest
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;[pytest]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; pytest.ini
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;norecursedirs=venv*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; pytest.ini
mkdir tests
touch myobj.py
touch tests/test_mock.py
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; py.test
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable is an easy way to avoid having to setup a whole Python project to just test some simple code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The three test types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sandy Metz we need to test only three types of messages (calls) between objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incoming queries (assertion on result)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incoming commands (assertion on direct public side effects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outgoing commands (expectation on call and arguments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the original talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or read the slides &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skmetz/magic-tricks-of-testing-railsconf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The final table is shown in slide number 176.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see when dealing with external objects we are only interested in knowing IF a method was called and WHAT PARAMETERS the caller passed to the object. We are not testing if the remote object returns the correct result, this is faked by the mock, which indeed returns exactly the result we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the purpose of the methods provided by mock objects is to allow us to check what methods we called on the mock itself and what parameters we used in the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asserting calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how to use Python mocks in testing I will follow the TDD methodology, writing tests first and then writing the code that makes the tests pass. In this post I want to give you a simple overview of the mock objects, so I will not implement a real world use case, and the code will be very trivial. In the second part of this series I will test and implement a real class, in order to show some more interesting use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we are usually interested in when dealing with an external object is to know that a given method has been called on it. Python mocks provide the &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method to check this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use case we are going to test is the following. &lt;em&gt;We instantiate the &lt;code&gt;myobj.MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class, which requires an external object. The class shall call the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method of the external object without any parameter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;myobj&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_instantiation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;myobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;myobj.MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class, in this simple example, needs to connect to an external object, for example a remote repository or a database. The only thing we need to know for testing purposes is if the class called the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method of the external object without any parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first thing we do in this test is to instantiate the mock object. This is a fake version of the external object, and its only purpose is to accept calls from the &lt;code&gt;MyObj&lt;/code&gt; object under test and return sensible values. Then we instantiate the &lt;code&gt;MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class passing the external object. We expect the class to call the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method so we express this expectation calling &lt;code&gt;external_obj.connect.assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens behind the scenes? The &lt;code&gt;MyObj&lt;/code&gt; class receives the external object and somewhere is its initialization process calls the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method of the mock object and this creates the method itself as a mock object. This new mock records the parameters used to call it and the subsequent call to &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; checks that the method was called and that no parameters were passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running pytest the test obviously fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; py.test

$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Putting this code in &lt;code&gt;myobj.py&lt;/code&gt; is enough to make the test pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method actually calls &lt;code&gt;repo.connect()&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; is expected to be a full-featured external object that provides a given API. In this case (for the moment) the API is just its &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; method. Calling &lt;code&gt;repo.connect()&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt; is a mock object silently creates the method as a mock object, as shown before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;assert_called_with()&lt;/code&gt; method also allows us to check the parameters we passed when calling. To show this let us pretend that we expect the &lt;code&gt;MyObj.setup()&lt;/code&gt; method to call &lt;code&gt;setup(cache=True, max_connections=256)&lt;/code&gt; on the external object. As you can see we pass a couple of arguments (namely &lt;code&gt;cache&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max_connections&lt;/code&gt;) to the called method, and we want to be sure that the call was exactly in this form. The new test is thus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;myobj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;external_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_called_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As usual the first run fails. Be sure to check this, it is part of the TDD methodology. You must have a test that DOES NOT PASS, then write some code that make it pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; py.test

$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To show you what type of check the mock object provides let me implement a partially correct solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_repo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the external object has been stored in &lt;code&gt;self._repo&lt;/code&gt; and the call to &lt;code&gt;self._repo.setup()&lt;/code&gt; is not exactly what the test expects, lacking the &lt;code&gt;max_connections&lt;/code&gt; parameter. Running pytest we obtain the following result (I removed most of the pytest output)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;E           AssertionError: Expected call: setup&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;True, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;max_connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;256&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
E           Actual call: setup&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;True&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and you see that the error message is very clear about what we expected and what happened in our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can read in the official documentation, the &lt;code&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; object also provides the following methods and attributes: &lt;code&gt;assert_called_once_with&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_any_call&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_has_calls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;assert_not_called&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;called&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call_count&lt;/code&gt;. Each of them explores a different aspect of the mock behaviour concerning calls, make sure to check their description and the examples provided along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first part of the series I described the behaviour of mock objects and the methods they provide to simulate return values and to test calls. They are a very powerful tool that allows you to avoid creating complex and slow tests that depend on external facilities to run, thus missing the main purpose of tests, which is that of &lt;em&gt;continuously&lt;/em&gt; helping you to check your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next issue of the series I will explore the automatic creation of mock methods from a given object and the very important patching mechanism provided by the &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; decorator and context manager.&lt;/p&gt;

We developed together a simple library which provides a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class that is a bit more useful than the default binary representation that Python provides with the &lt;code&gt;bin()&lt;/code&gt; builtin function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part I'll go on with the development of the library, discussing the implementation of a binary number with a fixed size, which is a very interesting and useful matter, being the foundation of the computer we are working with. Fixed-size binaries may also represent negative numbers with the two's complement technique, and this will be an important point to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may happen to dislike some decisions about the interface or the behaviour of the resulting class. Since this post is just a way to show you a concrete TDD session you are totally free to change the tests and to come up with a better solution than mine. Feel free to get in touch and submit better ideas, I'm always looking for something new to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already suggested in the first installment try to follow the post up to the section where I write the tests. Then move on implementing your own class and try to make it pass all the tests: this is the best way for you to learn TDD, actually applying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed-size binaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you build an electronic circuic to store information (a flip-flop, for example) you start dealing with binary numbers and with fixed-size quantities. Limiting the number of digits brings immediately the limitation of having a maximum number that can be represented and requires to decide what to do with bigger numbers. Another issue that arises is that of the representation of negative numbers. Since we can only use two symbols (one and zero) we have to decide a "syntax" for negative values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find a lot of information about some of those issues in the following Wikipedia articles: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow"&gt;Integer overflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations"&gt;signed number representations&lt;/a&gt;. Check also this page on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation"&gt;bitwise operations&lt;/a&gt; as some of them will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Object interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we aim to create a class called &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; that provides the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be instantiated giving a size in bits and a value. The value is optional, if not specified is 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value can be set after instantiation with a &lt;code&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If instantiated or set with a value greater than the maximum representable one the &lt;code&gt;overflow&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the object becomes &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May initialized with all the data types supported by the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class developed in the first post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just like the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class may be converted into an integer (e.g. &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, a binary string (e.g. &lt;code&gt;0b101010&lt;/code&gt;, an hexadecimal string (&lt;code&gt;0x2a&lt;/code&gt;) and a bit string (&lt;code&gt;101010&lt;/code&gt;). May also be converted to a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; without size limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support binary logic operations such as: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, shift left and right (without carry).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be splitted in two arbitrary sized &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be negated with both one's complement and two's complement techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, obeying the TDD methodology, I will write some tests that exploit these features. After this I'm going to develop an object that makes all test pass. Like we did in the previous post you may follow along as I write te tests and then write your own class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initialization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; object shall support all the initialization options supported by &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt;, but its main interface is different because when creating a &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; we must be allowed to specify the size. The first tests are though pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_init_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_init_int_overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;00010110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_set_overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;00000000&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will cover all the cases already covered for the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class. As you can see, I'm specifying the bit size when instantiating the object and testing the overflow condition. Other initialization and conversion tests are very similar to their &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; counterpart and I will not copy them here, as you can find them in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Splitting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the requirements is to provide a method to split a &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; object into two arbitrarily sized &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; objects. The tests are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01010110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary4u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary4l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary4u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary4l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_split_asymmetric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01010110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary9u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary3l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary9u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary3l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;000001010&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see the split shall be able to pad the resulting values if the number of bits exceedes that of the available ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negative numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many techniques to represent negative numbers with binary digits, and there is no way to tell from a binary number neither if it is positive or negative nor which technique has been used. It is a matter of conventions into the system in use. We want to implement &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones'_complement"&gt;one's complement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement"&gt;two's complement&lt;/a&gt;, which are described in detail in the linked Wikipedia articles. The tests to check the correct behaviour are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_size_binary_OC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 6 = 0b00000110 -&amp;gt; 0b11111001&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;11111001&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 7 = 0b00000111 -&amp;gt; 0b11111000&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;11111000&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;11110000&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1111111111110001&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Mathematics, indexing and slicing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic mathematical and logical operations are the same implemented for the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class. Some tests have been added to check what happens when performing operations between two &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; with a different size. We expect the result to have the size of the bigger of the two operands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_addition_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_addition_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_addition_binary_different_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being very straightforward, I do not copy here all the tests written to cover this part, you will find them in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the shift left operation now drops bits if there is not enough space for them, while the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class did it only for the shift right operation. For simplicity's sake I didn't implement a carry flag, i.e. there is no way to retrieve the bits shifted outside the available space. You are free to try and implement it, it's a good exercise but remember to write tests first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexing and slicing operations are basically the same as in the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; case. The slicing operation produces a new &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; with the correct size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation time!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now be a good OOP programmer and go, write a class that passes all the tests you find in the &lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part2/test_size_binary.py"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;. Just an advice, before you start headlong: being a &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; mostly a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; object with some new features it is recommended to use inheritance as the key delegation technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following my own advice my &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; class inherits from &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and with this simple declaration I get 1 test passed and still 50 to go. We obviously may also create a new object that does not inherit from &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; but we would have to explicitly delegate a lot of functions to this latter class. So, in this case, better to stick to an automatic delegation mechanism like inheritance. To get a review of those two concepts read &lt;a href="/blog/2014/08/20/python-3-oop-part-3-delegation-composition-and-inheritance"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composition could be another viable solution, with a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; value stored internally and accessed whenever we call &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; in the inheritance version. In this case, however, inheritance and composition lead to very similar results, with the latter being somehow counterintuitive and thus not the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to reimplement many of the special methods already implemented in the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class. This because Python resolves magic methods through a dedicated channel that avoids the &lt;code&gt;__getattr__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__()&lt;/code&gt; methods, making the whole thing faster. This makes impossible to automatically delegate magic methods, except by means of metaclasses, which are however too complex to be a useful addition to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialization function shall store the bit length and initialize a flag to signal the overflow condition. Since I also want to have a &lt;code&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt; function that changes the value I implement it and call it in the &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not that happy to poke into the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class implementation setting the &lt;code&gt;_value&lt;/code&gt; attribute, but this is the only way to change the value of the underlying &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class. If the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class had a &lt;code&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt; method we could call it through &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt;, and I cannot directly set it through &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; because I need to check the overflow condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this code I get a surprising result of 37 passed tests, while 14 still refuse to let me call it a day. This is however misleading, as many tests assume the &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; object correctly performs comparision, which is not the case, as shown by the failure of the &lt;code&gt;test_binary_equality_checks_bits&lt;/code&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was done on purpose, to show you that writing tests is not something that automatically guarantees you to have correct code. As a matter of fact, in this case tests like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_addition_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;do not fail, even if the result of the addition is a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; and not a &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us check why this happens. The &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; object is also a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; object, and its &lt;code&gt;__add__()&lt;/code&gt; method returns a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt;. The subsequent comparison is made using the &lt;code&gt;__eq__()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class, since the &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; one does not provide its own version of the comparison. Since &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; classes just compare their value the test ends successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us add some code to implement the correct comparision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__eq__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__eq__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which adds a check on the number of bits to the check already made by the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class. This results in 35 failed tests and 16 passed, showing that the previous result was biased by "inaccurate" tests. As a matter of fact, the presence of a test that shows if the comparison is correct or not makes perfectly reasonable to have tests that take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple thing to add is the right padding with zeros that shall be provided for input values that are shorter than the given number of bits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__str__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__str__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rjust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this simple addition lowers the count of failed tests from 35 to 30. Another small addition that satisfies 2 more tests is the splitting function, which shall return &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; objects instead of &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; ones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;upper_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upper_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As already explained we want to get the negative version of the number both with the one's complement and the two's complement techniques. For starters, let's deal with one's complement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very smart way to reverse all the n bits of a value x is to compute &lt;code&gt;(1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n) - x - 1&lt;/code&gt;. An example will show you that this works, avoiding long and boring mathematical explanations. We want to negate the number 1 represented as 8 bits ('00000001'). First we compute &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8&lt;/code&gt; which returns &lt;code&gt;100000000&lt;/code&gt;, then we subtract the value 1 of the number which returns &lt;code&gt;1111111&lt;/code&gt; and finally we subtract the constant 1, which returns &lt;code&gt;11111110&lt;/code&gt;. Look and behold! So this is exactly what I will implement for my &lt;code&gt;oc()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;oc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the same boring mathematics tomes we may discover that the two's complement representation of a number is its one's complement version plus 1. So the implementation of &lt;code&gt;tc()&lt;/code&gt; is straightforward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact this function doesn't make the relative test (&lt;code&gt;test_size_binary_TC&lt;/code&gt;) pass, because it depends on the correct implementation of the sum operation, which is still not implemented. So now the updated battle report is: 27 failed, 24 passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right and left shifts are the same of the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class, except that the result shall fit into the given bits. So we may delegate them to the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class implementation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__lshift__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__lshift__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__rshift__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__rshift__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this is enough to make the 5 related tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time for some arithmetic and logic functions. Since the internal representation of our value is always in base 10, as already done with the arithmetic functions of the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class we may go back to the base-10 world, perform the requested operation, and go back to the base-2 representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with those functions is that if we mix binaries with different sizes we want to "promote" the smaller one, to that the result has the size of the bigger. To handle this situation I isolated some code in a helper function called &lt;code&gt;_max_and_convert()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_max_and_convert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;sb_other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;sb_other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sb_other&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It checks if the &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; argument has a &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt; attribute, otherwise converts it into a &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt;. Then it returns the converted argument and the greatest length between this latter and &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;. Using this function I can then implement some magic methods such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__add__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sb_other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_max_and_convert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__add__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sb_other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This template is used to implement &lt;code&gt;__add__()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__sub__()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__mul__()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__truediv__()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__and__()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__or__()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__xor__()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;__invert__()&lt;/code&gt; method is simpler, missing the second argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__invert__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__invert__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With those functions I now have 49 successful tests and 2 still failing, namely &lt;code&gt;test_size_binary_to_binary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test_binary_slice&lt;/code&gt;. The first one depends on the missing &lt;code&gt;to_binary()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second needs some consideration: slicing depends on the &lt;code&gt;__getitem__()&lt;/code&gt; magic method, which is used also for the simple indexing, tested by &lt;code&gt;test_binary_get_bit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test_binary_negative_index&lt;/code&gt;, for example. The requested behaviour of the &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; class is to return a single character when indexing a single bit and a &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; or the correct length when slicing. The following code handles both situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getitem__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__getitem__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First of all I use the slicing function of the underlying &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; object which was already tested and correctly working. Then I compute the length of that result and act depending on the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia entries on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow"&gt;integer overflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations"&gt;signed number representations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation"&gt;bitwise operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code developed in this post can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full code of the &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; class is &lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part2/size_binary.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, while the tests file is &lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part2/test_size_binary.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part2/binary.zip"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you find a zip file containing both source code files and the relative tests.&lt;/li&gt;

I will develop a very simple Python package from scratch, exemplifying some Object-oriented Programming (OOP) techniques and concepts, and using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package will provide some classes to deal with binary numbers (see the Rationale section), but remember that it is just a toy project. Nothing in this package has been designed with performance in mind: it wants to be as clear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary numbers are rather easy to understand, even if becoming familiar with them requires some time. I expect you to have knowledge of the binary numeral system. If you need to review them just take a look at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; or one of the countless resources on Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package we are going to write will provide a class that represents binary numbers (&lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt;) and a class that represents binary numbers with a given bit size (&lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt;). They shall provide basic binary operations like logical (and, or, xor), arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), shifts and indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick example of what the package shall do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0101110001&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x171&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;369&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SHR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;10111000&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Python and bases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary system is just a &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; of numbers with base 2, just like hexadecimal (base 16) and decimal (base 10). Python can already natively deal with different bases, even if internally numbers are always stored as decimal integers. Let us check it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mb"&gt;0b101&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mb"&gt;0b101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0x5&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;#39;0b101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see Python understands some common bases out of the box, using the &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; prefix for hexadecimal numbers and the &lt;code&gt;0b&lt;/code&gt; for binary ones (and &lt;code&gt;0o&lt;/code&gt;) for octals). However the number is always printed in its base-10 form (&lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; in this case). This means however that a binary number cannot be indexed, since integers does not provide support for this operation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mb"&gt;0b101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;#39;int&amp;#39; object is not subscriptable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also use a different base when converting things to integers, through the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; parameter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple tasks are the best way to try and use new development methodologies, so this is a good occasion to start working with the so-called test-driven approach. Test-driven Development (TDD) basically means that the first thing you do when developing is to write some &lt;em&gt;tests&lt;/em&gt;, that is &lt;strong&gt;programs that use what you are going to develop&lt;/strong&gt;. The purpose of those programs is to test that your final product complies with a given behaviour. So they provide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; for your API: they are examples of use of your package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression&lt;/strong&gt; checks: when you change the code to develop new features they shall not break the behaviour of the previous package versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO list&lt;/strong&gt;: until all tests run successfully you have something still waiting to be implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest you to follow this post until we wrote some tests (section "Writing some tests" included), then &lt;strong&gt;write your own class, trying to make it pass all the tests&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, actually developing something, you can really learn both TDD and Python. Then you can check your code against mine and perhaps provide a far better solution that the one found by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us set up a simple environment for the upcoming development. First of all create a Python virtual environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;~$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;then activate the virtualenv and install py.test, which is what we will use to write tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;~$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; venv/bin/activate
&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~$ pip install pytest
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then create a directory for the package, the &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file and a directory for tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~$ mkdir binary
&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; binary
&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ touch __init__.py
&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ mkdir tests
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us check that everything is correctly working. Py.test does not find any test so it should exit without errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ py.test
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; session &lt;span class="nv"&gt;starts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
collected &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="o"&gt;=======================&lt;/span&gt;  in 0.00 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;======================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;[...]&lt;/code&gt; will be filled with information about your execution environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Py.test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach used by py.test is very straightforward: to test your library you just have to write some functions that use it. Those functions shall run without raising any exception; if a test (a function) runs without raising an exception it passes, otherwise it fails. Let us start writing a very simple test to learn the basic syntax. Create a &lt;code&gt;tests/test_binary.py&lt;/code&gt; file and write the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt; again you shall obtain this result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ py.test
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; session &lt;span class="nv"&gt;starts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
collected &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; items 

tests/test_binary.py .

&lt;span class="o"&gt;===================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; passed in 0.01 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;if you prefer (as I do) you may use the &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; verbose switch to get detailed information about what tests have been executed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ py.test -v
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; session &lt;span class="nv"&gt;starts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
collected &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; items 

tests/test_binary.py::test_first &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PASSED&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;===================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; passed in 0.01 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By default py.test looks for Python files which name starts with &lt;code&gt;test_&lt;/code&gt;, and this is why it processes our file &lt;code&gt;tests/test_binary.py&lt;/code&gt;. For each file it runs all functions which name, again, starts with &lt;code&gt;test_&lt;/code&gt;, and this is why &lt;code&gt;test_first()&lt;/code&gt; has been executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latter does nothing, so it runs without raising any exception and the test passes. Let us try to raise an exception&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which gives the following py.test output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ py.test -v
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; session &lt;span class="nv"&gt;starts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
collected &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; items 

tests/test_binary.py::test_first &lt;span class="nv"&gt;FAILED&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;===========================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;FAILURES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==========================&lt;/span&gt;
__________________________ test_first _________________________

    def test_first&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;:
&amp;gt;       raise ValueError
E       ValueError

tests/test_binary.py:2: &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;===================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; failed in 0.01 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To easily write tests that raise exceptions when failing we may use the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; Python statement, which shall be followed by an expression. If the expression returns a true value, &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; does nothing, otherwise it raises an &lt;code&gt;AssertionError&lt;/code&gt; exception. Let us do a quick check in the Python console&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;AssertionError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;AssertionError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So usually our tests will contain some code and one or more assertions. I prefer to have just one assertion for each test, except perhaps when testing the very same feature more than once (for example getting various elements from a list). This way you are immediately aware of what assertion raised the exception, that is you immediately know what feature does not work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing some tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we will pretend we have already developed our &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class and write some tests that check its behaviour. You will find the whole file in the Resources section at the end of the post, I will show here just some snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initialization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is our first real test. First of all we import the class from the &lt;code&gt;binary.py&lt;/code&gt; file (which doesn't exists yet). The &lt;code&gt;test_binary_init_int()&lt;/code&gt; function shall (as the name suggests) initialize a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; with an integer. The assertion checks that the newly created &lt;code&gt;binary&lt;/code&gt; variable has a consistent integer representation, which is the number we used to initialize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to initialize a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; with a wide range of values: bit strings (&lt;code&gt;'110'&lt;/code&gt;), binary strings (&lt;code&gt;'0b110'&lt;/code&gt;), hexadecimal strings (&lt;code&gt;'0x6'&lt;/code&gt;), hexadecimal values (&lt;code&gt;0x6&lt;/code&gt;), lists of integers (&lt;code&gt;[1,1,0]&lt;/code&gt;) and list of strings (&lt;code&gt;['1','1','0']&lt;/code&gt;). The following tests check all those cases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_bitstr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_binstr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0b110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_hexstr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0x6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_intseq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_strseq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us check that our &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class cannot be initialized with a negative number. I decided to represent negative numbers through the two's complement technique, which however requires a predefined bit length. So for simple binaries I just discard negative numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_init_negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, now we have to check that our class raises an exception, but if we make the class raise it the test will fail. To let the test pass we shall check that the exception is raised but suppress it, and this can be done with &lt;code&gt;pytest.raises&lt;/code&gt;, which is a suitable &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/"&gt;context manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conversions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to check that my binary numbers can be correctly converted to integers (through &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt;), binary strings (through &lt;code&gt;bin()&lt;/code&gt;), hexadecimals (through &lt;code&gt;hex()&lt;/code&gt;) and to strings (through &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt;). I want the string representation to be a plain sequence of zeros and ones, that is the binary string representation without the &lt;code&gt;0b&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples (check the full code for the whole set of tests)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Project structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I warmly suggest to check &lt;a href="https://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for a project layout that allows py.test to work flawlessly. To avoid putting too many things in this post I am going to run &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt; with a custom &lt;code&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; to make it correctly import the code. However, please remember that this setup is just a trick for simplicity's sake. Check &lt;a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/"&gt;this detailed post&lt;/a&gt; by Jeff Knupp to learn a lot about Python packaging and project layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing the class&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to run the tests at this point just returns a big failure due to an import error, since the &lt;code&gt;binary.py&lt;/code&gt; module does not exists yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;. py.test -v
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; session &lt;span class="nv"&gt;starts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=====================&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
collected &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; items / &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;============================&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ERRORS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===========================&lt;/span&gt;
____________ ERROR collecting tests/test_binary.py ____________

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let us create the file &lt;code&gt;binary.py&lt;/code&gt; in the project root (i.e. inside the &lt;code&gt;binary/&lt;/code&gt; directory you created, together with &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tests/&lt;/code&gt;) and start creating the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now running py.test shows that all tests can be run and that all them fail (I will just show the first one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;~/binary$ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;. py.test -v

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
collected &lt;span class="m"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; items

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So now you can start writing code and use your test battery to check if it works as expected. Obviously "as expected" means that all the tests you wrote pass, but this does not imply you covered all cases. TDD is an iterative methodology: when you find a bug or a missing feature you first write a good test or a set of tests that address the matter and then produce some code that make the tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point you are warmly encouraged to write the code by yourself&lt;/strong&gt; and to check your product with the given battery of tests. Just download the first version of the tests file (&lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part1/test_binary_ver1.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_binary_ver1.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and put it in the &lt;code&gt;tests/&lt;/code&gt; directory. Then read it carefully to understand what the requirements are and start writing the class. When you think you are done with a part of it just run the tests and see if everything works well, then move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most complex part of the class is the initialization, since I want it to accept a wide range of data types. Basically we have to deal with sequences (strings and lists) or with plain values. The latter ones shall be convertible to an integer, otherwise trying to initialize a binary number with them makes no sense. Since binary numbers are just a representation of integers I decided to store the value in the class as an integer inside the &lt;code&gt;self._value&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Pay attention that this decision means that all leading zeros will be stripped from the number, i.e., &lt;code&gt;Binary('000101')&lt;/code&gt; is equal to &lt;code&gt;Binary('101')&lt;/code&gt;. This will be important for indexing and slicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0x&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Binary cannot accept negative numbers. Use SizedBinary instead&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Cannot convert value {} to Binary&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__int__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Running the tests I get &lt;code&gt;4 failed, 9 passed in 0.02 seconds&lt;/code&gt;, which is a good score. The tests that still fail are &lt;code&gt;test_binary_eq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;test_binary_bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;test_binary_str&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test_binary_hex&lt;/code&gt;. Since I still wrote no code for the conversions those failures were expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us review the code I wrote. I make use of the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; module to tell apart sequences from plain values in a pythonic way. If you do not know what Abstract Base Classes are, please check &lt;a href="/blog/2014/09/04/python-3-oop-part-6-abstract-base-classes"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;collections.abc&lt;/code&gt; module documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: if you are using Python 3.2 or less you will find those classes in the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; module instead of &lt;code&gt;collections.abc&lt;/code&gt;, which has been introduced with Python 3.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically through &lt;code&gt;isinstance(value, collections.abc.Sequence)&lt;/code&gt; we check that the incoming value &lt;em&gt;behaves&lt;/em&gt; like a sequence, which is different from saying that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, or other sequences. The first case covers an incoming string in the form &lt;code&gt;0bXXXXX&lt;/code&gt;, which is converted to an integer through the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function. The second case is the same but for hexadecimal strings in the form &lt;code&gt;0xXXXXX&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third case covers a generic sequence of values that shall be individually convertible to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. The code converts each element of the sequence to a string, joins them in a single string and converts it with base 2. This covers the case of a string of zeros and ones and the case of an iterable of integers, like a list for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the incoming value is not a sequence it shall be convertible to an integer, which is exactly what the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; part does. Here we also check if the value is negative and raise a suitable exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;__int__()&lt;/code&gt; method (one of the Python &lt;em&gt;magic methods&lt;/em&gt;) is automatically called when we apply &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; to our binary, just like we do in a lot of the tests. This method is basically the one responsible of providing a conversion to integer of a given class. In this case we just have to return the value we stored internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obviously I didn't write this code in a single burst. I had to run the tests more than once to tune my code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already wrote the method that performs the conversion to an integer. Some tests however (namely &lt;code&gt;test_binary_bin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test_binary_hex&lt;/code&gt;) still fail with the error message &lt;code&gt;TypeError: 'Binary' object cannot be interpreted as an integer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bin"&gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt;,  "If x is not a Python int object, it has to define an &lt;code&gt;__index__()&lt;/code&gt; method that returns an integer." so this is what we are missing. As for &lt;code&gt;__index__()&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; states that "In order to have a coherent integer type class, when &lt;code&gt;__index__()&lt;/code&gt; is defined &lt;code&gt;__int__()&lt;/code&gt; should also be defined, and both should return the same value."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we just have to add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__index__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__int__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;inside the class, and we get two more successful tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make &lt;code&gt;test_binary_str&lt;/code&gt; pass we have to provide a magic method that converts the object into a string, which is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__str__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It makes use of the internal Python algorithm provided by &lt;code&gt;bin()&lt;/code&gt; stripping the &lt;code&gt;0b&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last failing test is &lt;code&gt;test_binary_eq&lt;/code&gt; which tests for equality between two &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, Python compares objects on a very low level, just checking if the two references point to the same object in memory. To make it smarter we have to provide the &lt;code&gt;__eq__()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__eq__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now all the tests run successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Binary operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to add new features to our &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class. As already said, the TDD methodology wants us to first write the tests, then to write the code. Our class is missing some basic arithmetic and binary operations so the tests are (again you will find all tests in the attached file)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_addition_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_addition_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_division_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_division_rem_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_get_bit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0101110001&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_shl_pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110100000&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first two tests check that adding both an integer and a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; works as expected. The division checks two different cases: because integer division produces a remainder, which is not considered here. The &lt;code&gt;test_binary_get_bit&lt;/code&gt; function tests indexing and is one of the few tests that contain more than one assertion. Please note that binary indexing, unlike standard sequence indexing in Python, starts from the rightmost element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitwise and arithmetic operations are implemented using Python magic methods. Please check &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/operator.html"&gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt; for a complete list of operators and related methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now download the file &lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part1/test_binary_ver2.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_binary_ver2.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and use it to develop the new features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that implements the required behaviour is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__and__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__or__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__xor__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__lshift__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__invert__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All methods are straightforward, except perhaps &lt;code&gt;__getitem__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__invert__()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;__invert__()&lt;/code&gt; method is called when performing a bitwise NOT operation (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) and is implemented avoiding negative numbers. A simple solution is to convert the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; into a string and then reverse every digit (&lt;code&gt;abs(int(i) - 1)&lt;/code&gt; returns 0 for '1' and 1 for '0').&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;__getitem__()&lt;/code&gt; method is required to provide indexing, and as said shall index starting from the rightmost element and moving left. This is the reason of the &lt;code&gt;-(item + 1)&lt;/code&gt; index. Please notice that this method will be changed later to provide full support to slicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slicing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; to support slicing, just like lists. The difference between lists and my &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; type is that for the latter indexes start from the rightmost element. So when I get bits 3:7 of an 8-bit &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; I obtain the four leftmost ones. The desired behaviour is thus exemplified by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01101010&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;binary.Binary object at 0x...&amp;gt; (110)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;binary.Binary object at 0x...&amp;gt; (101)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;that can immediately be converted into tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01101010&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01101010&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;101&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01101010&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will find the new tests in the &lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part1/test_binary_ver3.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_binary_ver3.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the tests shows that the &lt;code&gt;__getitem__()&lt;/code&gt; function does not provide support for &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt; objects, raising the exception &lt;code&gt;TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'slice' and 'int'&lt;/code&gt;. Checking &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__"&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;__getitem__()&lt;/code&gt; we notice that it shall manage both integers and &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt; objects (this is the missing part) and that it shall raise &lt;code&gt;IndexError&lt;/code&gt; for illegal indexes to make for loops work. So I immediately add a test for this rule&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_illegal_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;IndexError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;01101010&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and other tests to match the correct behaviour (you will find them in the full code). Remember that leading zeros are stripped, so getting the index number 7 shall fail, since the binary number has just 7 digits, even if the incoming string has 8 characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to reimplement the whole list slicing behaviour with reversed indexes, it is much simpler to make use of it. We can just take the string version of our &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt;, slice its reversed version and return the result (reversed again). The result of the slice can be a single element, however, so we have to check it against the &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getitem__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;reversed_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;sliced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reversed_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__getitem__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sliced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sliced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sliced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sliced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first list comprehension returns a list of integers with the reversed version of the binary number (i.e. from &lt;code&gt;Binary('01101')&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;[1, 0, 1, 1]&lt;/code&gt;, remember that leading zeros are stripped). Then we delegate the slice to the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; type, calling &lt;code&gt;__getitem__()&lt;/code&gt;. The result of this call may be a sequence or a single element (integer), so we tell apart the two cases. In the first case we reverse the result again, in the second case we just return it. In both cases we create a &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; object. The check on the length of the list must be introduced because the slice may return no elements, but the &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; class does not accept an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Splitting binaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last feature I want to add is a &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; function that divides the binary number in two binaries. The rightmost one shall have the given size in bits, while the leftmost just contains the remaining bits. The following tests exemplify the behaviour of &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_split_no_remainder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_split_remainder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_split_exact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;100010110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;100010110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_binary_split_leading_zeros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;100010110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;10110&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These new tests are in the file &lt;a href="/code/python-oop-tdd-part1/test_binary_ver4.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_binary_ver4.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that implements it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you tried and write your own class before checking my solution I'm sure you experienced both some frustration when tests failed and a great joy when they finally passed. I'm also sure that you could appreciate the simplicity of TDD and perhaps understand why so many programmes adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post I will guide you through the addition of the &lt;code&gt;SizeBinary&lt;/code&gt; class, again following the TDD methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015-05-15 As suggested by &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110554719587236016835/+JacobZimmermanCrapEDM/posts"&gt;Jacob Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/110554719587236016835/posts/F7TrsivP94B"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; the class lacks some methods to be a complete numeric class, most notably &lt;code&gt;__radd__&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__rsub__&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed, my first goal was to show TDD so I did not add the whole series of reflected arithmetic operations. You will find all those methods &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and try to implement them following the methodology shown in the post. Jacob also suggested to shorten the &lt;code&gt;__str__()&lt;/code&gt; implementation, and I fixed it. Thanks Jacob!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015-09-22 &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmccormack"&gt;Christopher McCormack&lt;/a&gt; spotted an error about binary indexing: "starts from the leftmost element" should be "starts from the rightmost element". Now it has been fixed. Thanks Christopher!&lt;/p&gt;
